Originally meant to host the United States\u2019 first private orbital launch complex for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, only a small amount of work \u2013 known as soil surcharging \u2013 was done in the four years that followed SpaceX\u2019s 2014 announcement.

", "Outside of the \u2018sprung structure\u2019 (i.e. tent) shown in Musk\u2019s February 9th photo, SpaceX contractors appear to be just days away from completing the shell of a second identical tent, ultimately doubling the space available for enclosed manufacturing operations. At the same time as both Starship hardware and production facilities are rapidly coming together, SpaceX is also erecting what is presumed to be a Vehicle Assembly Building \u2013 a potentially massive structure that will protect vertical Starships and Super Heavy boosters from the elements while workers assemble them into finished rockets.", "Inside the finished tent, SpaceX appears to have set up the first true Starship assembly line (of sorts), expanding from working on a single kind of prototype at a time to concurrent (serial) production of major components. Visible are three Starship bulkheads (tank domes) \u2013 two completed instances of which have already been transported outside and integrated with finished ring segments, forming two halves of Starship SN01\u2019s complete liquid methane (LCH4) tank.", "Near the back of the tent, work is also ongoing on several Starship SN01 tank rings. In the center, technicians are outfitting Starship SN01\u2019s engine and \u2018skirt\u2019 section, where the bottommost tank dome will attach to three (up to six) Raptor engines.

In a bizarre turn of events, Russian news agency TASS published a separate article barely 12 hours later, in which \u2013 once again \u2013 an anonymous space agency source told the outlet that \u201cthe [DM-2] launch of Crew Dragon is likely to be postponed to November\u201d. For the time being, the reality likely stands somewhere in the middle.", "While it\u2019s hard not to jump to conclusions about the oddity of two wholly contradictory reports arising from similar sources in similar articles just half a day apart, it\u2019s just as likely that the near-simultaneous publishing of both TASS and RIA stories is mainly a coincidence. At the same time, truth can be found in both comments made by the anonymous source(s), while they also offer a sort of best-case and worst-case scenario for the first crewed launch of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft. ", "RIA began the series on March 22nd with a brief news blurb featuring one substantive quote from the aforementioned space industry source.", "\u201cThe American side informed the Russian side that the launch of the [first crewed launch of] Dragon-2\u2026to the ISS\u2026is scheduled for July 25. The docking with the station is scheduled [to occur around one day later]. The separation from the ISS and return to Earth is expected on August 5,\u201d the agency\u2019s source said.", "Put in a slightly different way, NASA informed Roscosmos that it had begun to loosely plan for the launch of SpaceX\u2019s DM-2 no earlier than (NET) late July, much like NASA and SpaceX publicly announced that Crew Dragon\u2019s ", "DM-1 launch debut was scheduled", " NET January 17th as of early December 2018. DM-1\u2019s actual debut wound up occurring on March 2nd, a delay of approximately six weeks. The cause(s) behind the discrepancy between NASA\u2019s first serious planning date and the actual launch remains unknown but it\u2019s safe to say that things took quite a bit longer than expected even after Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 were technically \u201cgo\u201d for launch.", "Although NASA and SpaceX now have the luxury of a vast cache of flight data and the practical experience derived from conducting Crew Dragon\u2019s first \u2013 and nearly flawless \u2013 orbital launch and ISS rendezvous, Crew Dragon\u2019s DM-2 mission remains an entirely different animal. Aside from requiring a number of significant hardware changes and introducing the visceral pressure of real human lives hanging in the balance, DM-2 will be a major first for the NASA after having spent the better part of eight years unable to launch its own astronauts into orbit.", "Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft \u2013 a companion to Crew Dragon under NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program \u2013 has suffered multiple setbacks in 2019, reportedly pushing the vehicle\u2019s ", "uncrewed", " launch debut from April to NET August, a delay of at least four months. As a result, nothing short of severe anomalies during Crew Dragon hardware preparation and/or NASA\u2019s reviews of DM-1 performance and DM-2 flight-readiness could prevent SpaceX from becoming the first commercial entity to build, launch, and operate a crewed spacecraft in the history of spaceflight.", "According to a December 2018 update provided during NASA\u2019s quarterly Advisory Council meetings, the entirety of Crew Dragon DM-2\u2019s manufacturing and integration may already be complete, with the capsule potentially heading to SpaceX\u2019s Florida payload processing facilities later this week. NAC\u2019s December 2018 dates did not, however, account for the DM-1 launch delays that shortly followed, plausibly impacting the completion of DM-2 integration and pad delivery to ensure that any potential anomalies experienced during Crew Dragon\u2019s test flight could be resolved in Hawthorne, CA. ", "According to NASA and SpaceX, DM-2\u2019s Crew Dragon will need to be retrofitted with thermal regulation hardware to prevent Draco thruster plumbing from freezing under a handful of specific conditions on orbit, as well as potential modifications to the craft\u2019s parachute system and the installation of four windows instead of two. SpaceX will also need to install Crew Dragon\u2019s first orbit-ready display and control hardware. Finally, SpaceX has opted to conduct an in-flight abort (IFA) test of Crew Dragon to verify that the spacecraft can safely carry astronauts to safety from the moment of launch to orbital insertion, a test that will have to be completed successfully and reviewed by NASA before the agency allows SpaceX to proceed with DM-2.", "All of the above tasks \u2013 including major agency-wide reviews of Crew Dragon\u2019s performance during its DM-1 debut \u2013 must be completed before SpaceX will be permitted to launch astronauts to the ISS, all of which inherently add some level of uncertainty to DM-2\u2019s practical launch schedule. If all reviews and modifications proceed flawlessly, including a perfect in-flight abort test as early as late June, it\u2019s possible that SpaceX and NASA could be prepared to launch Crew Dragon once more by the end of July.", "In reality, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that everything will proceed perfectly, as evidenced by the drawn-out process required for NASA and SpaceX to eventually reach flight-readiness prior to DM-1. If a significant number of challenges arise over the next few months of reviews and work, it\u2019s not out of the question for DM-2\u2019s launch to slip to Q4 2019 or Q1 2020. Splitting the difference, it would be safest to bet that Crew Dragon will lift off with astronauts aboard no earlier than August or September. Regardless, a great many exciting milestones are soon to come for SpaceX\u2019s first human spaceflight program.

Nevertheless, if the data from this static fire show a healthy spacecraft and rocket, SpaceX will likely be well on their way to the first (uncrewed) orbital launch of Crew Dragon, currently expected no earlier than (NET) the second half of February.", "In an intriguing sign that Crew Dragon was fully fueled and ready to abort at any second, SpaceX Dragon recovery vessel ", "GO Searcher\u00a0was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean", " just a few miles East of Falcon 9\u2019s static fire attempt at Pad 39A. In other words, if Falcon 9 were to have experienced a potentially catastrophic anomaly during propellant loading or Merlin 1D ignition, Crew Dragon would have likely ignited its 8 Super Draco abort thrusters to rapidly accelerate away from the rocket, theoretically saving itself (and any astronauts aboard). GO Searcher would have then quickly recovered the forlorn spacecraft after it deployed its parachutes and landed in the ocean, essentially a replay of the Pad Abort test SpaceX engineers and technicians completed in 2015.", "Designed with the sole intention of ensuring that Crew Dragon is capable of safely aborting an anomalous launch and carrying astronauts to safety at almost any point between ignition\u00a0and orbit, that same launch abort system (LAS) also offers the option for Crew Dragon to escape a potentially damaging situation even without a crew aboard. In the latter case, Crew Dragon\u2019s hardware would be preserved for potential refurbishment and reuse, likely saving SpaceX and NASA tens of millions of dollars\u00a0(if not $100M+) and cutting months off of the inevitable delays that would follow. Crew Dragon\u2019s integrated LAS \u2013 meaning that the spacecraft brings it wherever it goes \u2013 is completely unique in the history of crewed\u00a0spaceflight and ultimately offers unbeatable protection for any astronauts or passengers entrusted to it.", "Thanks in large part to undoubtedly disruptive NASA demands that may well be far more conservative than necessary, SpaceX extensively re-engineered Falcon 9 for ease of manufacturing and extreme reliability, both of which go hand in hand. Among dozens of minor to major changes, M1D and MVac engines were modified to mitigate minor problems with turbopump blades fracturing, overall avionics redundancy was upgraded, and Falcon\u2019s ultra-high-pressure helium storage tanks (COPVs) were drastically redesigned.", "These upgrades were ultimately integrated into the iteration known as Block 5. According to SpaceX\u2019s updated Falcon 9 and Heavy payload user guide, \u201c[aside from the payload interface], all first- and second-stage vehicle systems are the same [for Dragon and satellite launches], indicating that the same exact rocket is produced for any given single-stick Falcon 9 launch. This means that all SpaceX customers, US government or not, benefit directly from the reliability demanded by NASA and the US military for crewed and uncrewed launches. It also means that SpaceX\u2019s production system remains exceptionally simple, as just a single upper stage and booster variation is needed for the vast majority of the company\u2019s launches. Falcon Heavy requires a unique center core booster and nosecones but is otherwise unchanged from Falcon 9.", "According to Russian media, SpaceX is now targeting Crew Dragon\u2019s launch debut NET February 16th.

Thursday, April 11th\u2019s recycled launch window is identical to Wednesday\u2019s, stretching from 6:35pm-8:31pm ET (22:35-00:31 UTC). ", "According to SpaceX, both the Falcon Heavy Block 5 rocket and its Arabsat 6A satellite payload are in good health and would have been ready to launch on April 10th if the weather had been slightly more cooperative. While seemingly innocuous, something as basic as wind currents can risk the partial or total failure of rockets even as large as Falcon Heavy, The intricacy and stress-optimized nature of Falcon Heavy\u2019s three interlinked boosters make the rocket particularly susceptible to off-nominal aerodynamic stresses, constantly performing a sort of balancing act to keep those boosters flying in a sort of formation at extreme speeds.", "While rockets are also susceptible to extreme ground-level wind conditions, upper-level wind violations are far more common, particularly for SpaceX\u2019s Falcon family. Falcon 9 and Heavy are uniquely at the mercy of these conditions due to a fineness ratio (height vs. width) unprecedented at their level of performance. In fact, Falcon boosters are so long, skinny, and mass-optimized that SpaceX actually pressurizes them with nitrogen during extended/unsupported periods in a horizontal orientation. In simpler terms, held near its extremities, Falcon first stages can actually damage themselves under their own weight by bending somewhere in the middle.", "Past a certain point, this bending is highly undesirable. The walls of Falcon 9\u2019s lithium-aluminum alloy propellant tanks \u2013 also doubling as part of the rocket\u2019s load-bearing structure \u2013 are approximately 0.2 in (5mm) thick, around 40% thinner than an iPhone X. Weighing approximately 25,000 kg (55,000 lb) empty yet 550,000 kg (1,210,000 lb) when full of fuel, Falcon 9 is thus a bit like a rolled sheet of printer paper balancing under a textbook while accelerating at several Gs. ", "The problem is that Earth\u2019s atmosphere is heavily stratified: there are many different horizontal layers of air that can end up moving in very different directions at very different speeds. Imagine for a second that you\u2019re sprinting along a sidewalk but each sidewalk section is actually a treadmill moving slightly left or right. Running along at full speed, you abruptly hit several sections that are rapidly moving, say, ", "right", ". Bad times are had. For Falcon Heavy (or 9), running into high upper-level winds is much less exaggerated but still ends up having the same effect: the rocket, like the runner, loses control authority and ends up a fair bit more sideways than intended. When rockets find themselves tilting more than a few degrees off of their vector, they start to bend and flex ", "a lot", ". When rockets more than minutely bend and flex, they have a tendency to crumple and warp to the point that they will literally break into pieces a bit like a partially cooked spaghetti noodle.", "Those same forces act on Falcon Heavy quite a bit differently than they do on a single Falcon 9, but the principle remains the same: sideways booster = bad news. The wind wins this round but SpaceX will be ready for another attempt today. Likely a strategic choice, Wednesday\u2019s launch attempt was called off just shy of 20 minutes before propellant loading began, dramatically simplifying the process of turning Falcon Heavy around for another launch attempt.

With Oleg\u2019s extremely high-resolution captures, we can begin to see SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon with a level of detail previously only seen (if ever) on the ground.", "In all fairness to NASA, the ISS is operating with just three crew members, only one of which \u2013 Anne McClain \u2013 is a NASA astronaut. Particularly the case for an operation as critical as Crew Dragon\u2019s inaugural orbital docking attempt, the task of controlling space vehicle rendezvous typically requires the full attention of one or two onboard astronauts \u2013 in this case, NASA\u2019s Anne McClain and Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut\u00a0David Saint-Jacques. Veteran Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, however, was required by\u00a0Roscosmos to remain in the Russian segment of the ISS in the event of a catastrophic anomaly during Crew Dragon\u2019s approach to the station.", "Just prior to launch, NASA broke the news that its Russian ISS partners had expressed concerns about the design of Crew Dragon\u2019s approach trajectory, mainly focusing on the fact that a loss of control or communications while moving towards the station would leave no way for the spacecraft to naturally slow down. In other words, a dead spacecraft with a forward velocity would simply continue moving forward until it impacted the ISS, a bit like a semi-truck crash in slow motion (i.e. < 0.5 m/s or 1 mph). Weighing a hefty 12 tons (~26,600 lbs) during the arrival, even an extremely low-speed impact could undoubtedly do some damage to the ISS, although an actual hull breach (and thus a need to evacuate) would be extraordinarily unlikely. Still, Oleg was unable to significantly assist during the rendezvous itself, although the cosmonaut was front and center after Crew Dragon\u2019s successful capture.", "Taking advantage of the opportunity to observe, the cosmonaut was able to take a number of photos of Crew Dragon\u2019s arrival, although the location of its docking port makes for a less than optimal perspective. Still, it\u2019s hard to complain about any extremely high-quality photos of Crew Dragon, and Oleg\u2019s are nothing short of spectacular.

According to the SpaceX and NASA hosts of the live docking coverage, Crew Dragon\u2019s DM-1 departure from the ISS will also be treated to a hosted webcast, potentially all the way through reentry and recovery aboard the customized SpaceX vessel GO Searcher. According to CEO Elon Musk, there is a slight but present chance of anomalous behavior during reentry due to aerodynamic instability caused by the shrouds covering Crew Dragon\u2019s unique SuperDraco abort system, while NASA continues to have concerns (largely unexplained) about the spacecraft\u2019s redundant parachute system.", "Regardless of technical concerns, Crew Dragon\u2019s reentry will be the final critical challenge in the way of completing its first demonstration launch (DM-1), proceeded by a flawless launch and equally flawless docking.

The next closest entrant \u2013 Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket \u2013 is unlikely to be ready for its launch debut before late \u201921 or early \u201922. ULA\u2019s \u201cSMART\u201d reuse of Vulcan rocket engine sections is unlikely to be ready before the mid-2020s, likely 2024-2026. ", "SpaceX, however, has already reused Falcon 9 boosters more than 20 times on orbital-class missions, and the frequency of reuse is only likely to increase with the introduction of the final major Falcon 9 and Heavy upgrade, known as Block 5. Designed with a nominal lifespan of 10+ launches, each booster can support a huge number of missions and also offers the potential to dramatically reduce launch costs down the road. Additionally, as noted by VP of Launch Reliability Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX firmly believes that reliability will come hand in hand with routine reuse, as each recovered booster can serve as a treasure trove of data. Thanks to reusability, SpaceX can fill recoverable boosters to the brim with cameras and gather full-resolution telemetry otherwise inaccessible for an expendable rocket. ", "The matter of launch costs is not a particularly significant concern of the US military, mainly a consequence of the incredibly disproportionate relationship between the cost of launch and the cost the military satellite payloads. An excellent example of this disparity can be found in SpaceX\u2019s December 2018 launch of the USAF\u2019s first GPS III satellite: SpaceX\u2019s launch contract cost $82M, while the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft aboard cost no less than ~$600M. ", "However, reusable rockets are quite plainly the future of space launch, evidenced by SpaceX\u2019s meteoric rise and rapid cannibalization of the global commercial launch market. As a partial result, the survival of ULA \u2013 a Lockheed Martin-Boeing cooperative that builds the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets \u2013 is almost completely dependent upon military development and launch contracts. Blue Origin, however, is now offering the promise of an independently stable launch provider thanks to continual funding from owner Jeff Bezos, and reusability will be an absolute necessity if its massive New Glenn rocket is to succeed. ", "In short, the USAF is faced with a simple proposition: get behind reusable rockets or risk falling behind. SpaceX is more than happy to ease the conservative military branch into the new era, and Falcon Heavy\u2019s STP-2 launch will be a major step in the right direction. Thanks to its reuse of two side boosters, Air Force officials will be able to observe the process of rapid refurbishment firsthand, providing information they will then use to develop certification requirements for flight-proven rockets. More generally, STP-2 will also act as a dedicated demonstration that SpaceX and the USAF will use to fully certify Falcon Heavy for military launches, hopefully ending Delta IV Heavy\u2019s decade-long monopoly over military heavy lift.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

", "Update: ", "Tim Chen has retracted his earlier comments and has stated that there is actually no agreement currently in place with SpaceX for RUAG to produce taller fairings out of its new Decatur, AL factory. ", "Additionally, ULA CEO Tory Bruno clarified that the company\u2019s \u201c[new fairing] has [ULA] intellectual property in its design and manufacture \u2026 [and] is currently planned only for use on Atlas and Vulcan\u201d, meaning that any cooperation between SpaceX and RUAG would likely require a new production facility and a somewhat different fairing design.", "\u201cULA\u2019s new fairing, which is built in our factory in Decatur, has our intellectual property in its design and manufacture. This fairing is currently planned only for use on Atlas and Vulcan. You would want to ask RUAG about business they might have with their other customers.\u201d", "Tory Bruno, August 14th, 2019", "Regardless of the veracity of these recent claims, it appears that SpaceX has three obvious responses at its disposal: design and build an entirely new variant of its universal Falcon fairing, purchase the necessary fairings from an established supplier, or bow out of launch contract competitions that demand it. The latter option is immediately untenable given that it could very well mean bowing out of the entire US military competition, known as Phase 2 of the National Security Space Launch program\u2019s (NSSL; formerly EELV) Launch Services Procurement (LSP).", "For dubious reasons, the US Air Force (USAF) has structured the NSSL Phase 2 acquisition in such a way that \u2013 despite there being four possible competitors \u2013 only two will be awarded contracts at its conclusion. The roughly ~30 launch contracts up for grabs would be split 60:40 between the two victors, leaving two competitors completely emptyhanded. In short, bowing out of the Phase 2 competition could mean forgoing as many as one or two-dozen contracts worth at least $1-2B, depending on the side of the 60:40 split.", "According to a handful of recent comments and developments, SpaceX has likely sided with the option of procuring taller fairings from an industry supplier. As it turns out, European company RUAG has effectively cornered the Western rocket fairing market, with SpaceX being the only Western launch company currently building its own fairings. RUAG builds fairings for both Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 5 and Vega rockets and ULA\u2019s Atlas V. Additionally, RUAG will build and supply fairings for both companies\u2019 next-gen rockets \u2013 Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 6 and ULA\u2019s Vulcan \u2013 and builds fairings for a number of smallsat launch companies.", "Comments made in June by a RUAG official confirmed that there was some semblance of a relationship between SpaceX and RUAG for the purpose of satisfying USAF needs for taller fairings, although the phrasing suggested that the cooperation was in its early stages and nothing had been solidified.", "\u201cIn a June 12 letter to Smith, the company\u2019s CEO Peter Guggenbach makes the case that legislation forcing access to suppliers is unnecessary in this case because RUAG does not have an exclusive arrangement with ULA and is willing to work with SpaceX or any other launch providers.", "\u201cFor this competition, we are in the process of submitting or have submitted proposals to multiple prime contractors regarding launch vehicle fairings. In those agreements, we share technical data to support a prime contractor\u2019s bid while protecting our intellectual property.\u201d", "RUAG vice president Karl Jensen told\u00a0", "SpaceNews", "\u00a0the company has a \u201csignificant partnership\u201d with ULA but is looking to work with others too. \u201cWe have an offer to SpaceX,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d", "SpaceNews, 06/13/2019", "Interestingly, although ULA\u2019s RUAG-built Atlas V fairing is slightly narrower than SpaceX\u2019s 5.2m (17 ft) diameter fairing, Atlas V\u2019s largest fairing is significantly taller, supporting payloads up to 16.5m (54 ft) tall compared to 11m (36 ft) for Falcon 9 and Heavy. Given that just a tiny portion of military spacecraft actually need fairings that tall, SpaceX is apparently not interested in simply modifying its own fairing design and production equipment to support a 20-30% stretch.", "This likely relates in part to the fact that one of SpaceX\u2019s three NSSL Phase 2 competitors \u2013 Northrop Grumman (Omega), Blue Origin (New Glenn), and ULA (Vulcan) \u2013 are guaranteed to receive hundreds of millions of dollars of development funding after winning one of the two available slots (60% or 40% of contracts). SpaceX, on the other hand, will receive no such funding while still having to meet the same stringent USAF requirements compete in LSP Phase 2.

At the moment, SpaceX appears to be focused on testing Raptor at its McGregor, Texas development facilities. This is no surprise for a cutting-edge rocket engine less than four months into full-scale testing, as inevitable off-nominal or unexpected behavior revealed during test fires can often lead to design optimizations or even major changes.", "Since the first finalized Raptor was delivered to McGregor in late January, SpaceX has completed an average of one new engine per month, all of which have then been tested in Texas. After completing its McGregor acceptance tests, SN03 also became the first Raptor engine to leave the ground under its own power as part of Starhopper\u2019s first two tethered hops.

Buried in the more than 1,000 page appropriations bill approved\u00a0just before Christmas, it gave ULA approval to\u00a0buy a supply of RD-180s \u2014 just enough to keep it in the military launch business for the time being.

Nevertheless, JRTI\u2019s presence at either (or, more likely, both) possible destinations arguably centers around the imminent demands of a planned ramp of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite constellation launch cadence, as well as an equally imminent need for recovery assets to support the first suborbital Starship test flights.", "On July 31st, JRTI departed Port of Los Angeles \u2013 its home for the last four years \u2013 under tow behind tugboat Alice C. The duo arrived at the Canal on August 15th and, after a several-day wait in a large passage queue, the drone ship and its paired tugboat are finally on their way through the canal, although traffic still remains high and another day (or several) of waiting is likely in order.", "After successfully making it through the first half of the transit, JRTI and Alice C are currently waiting in line while westbound traffic is routed through. That wait will likely last hours, not days, (hopefully) allowing JRTI to exit the canal on Tuesday or Wednesday, leaving drone ship free to head towards its final destination.", "JRTI has two possible destinations: Port of Brownsville, Texas or Port Canaveral, Florida. Both options are roughly 1800 mi (3000 km) from the Panama Canal\u2019s western mouth and, extrapolating from the first major leg of the journey, should take Alice C around 8 days to tow JRTI across the finish line. Barring mishaps, the drone ship should thus be able to arrive at its new home sometime in the final week of August \u2013 roughly August 27th to the 31st. ", "As previously discussed on Teslarati, there are good cases to make for ", "both potential drone ship destinations", ". On the East Coast, SpaceX\u2019s plans to ramp up its internal Starlink launch cadence could require multiple drone ship to prevent those ambitions from seriously impacting the company\u2019s commercial launch manifest. The readiness of one or two of the payloads is uncertain, but SpaceX has anywhere from seven to nine Falcon 9 launches scheduled in Q4 2019, requiring a cadence significantly higher than SpaceX\u2019s activity in the first half of 2019.", "At the same time, extrapolating from SpaceX\u2019s H1 2019 cadence (1.33 launches per month), more than doubling that average cadence to 3 launches per month in the final quarter seems ambitious, at a minimum. SpaceX has achieved six-launch quarters several times in the last few years, likely a reasonable expectation for Q4 2019. In short, this is all to say that SpaceX has made do with one drone ship in the past while hitting similar launch cadences, meaning that the need for JRTI at Port Canaveral is probably not urgent.", "On the Gulf Coast, SpaceX has established a Starship development facility in Boca Chica, Texas, just a handful of miles north of the southernmost tip of Texas. A full-scale, low-fidelity prototype known as Starhopper completed its first test flight on July 25th and is likely just days away from a second test flight. Meanwhile, SpaceX Boca Chica is simultaneously assembling what CEO Elon Musk has described as the \u201cMk1\u201d orbital Starship prototype and is making spectacularly rapid progress.

Per additional statements from Musk in 2018 and 2019, SpaceX plans to subject either or both of its Mk1 and Mk1 Starships to a high-altitude, high-velocity test program before proceeding to orbital launch attempts. ", "Said extreme testing could easily involve Starship traveling on high suborbital trajectories dozens or even hundreds of miles above Earth\u2019s surface, potentially demanding an ocean-going landing platform far downrange. Given that Starship is in its very early stages of integrated development, any downrange assets (i.e. JRTI) needed for test flights will need to be very flexible, as Starship launch attempts could easily slip days or weeks with little to no notice. ", "Although pitting options against each other is entertaining and has its uses, the fact remains that once drone ship JRTI has passed through the Panama Canal, traveling from, say, Florida to Texas or vice versa is far less arduous a journey than the trip from Port of LA. In other words, moving JRTI between Port of Brownsville and Port Canaveral every few months should be very little trouble, easily allowing the drone ship to service both Gulf and East Coast recovery needs.", "Given that SpaceX\u2019s next Falcon 9 launch is believed to be no earlier than late-October, it\u2019s not even out of the question that JRTI will stop in Brownsville for one month or several before heading to Port Canaveral as SpaceX attempts to complete a very busy Q4 2019 launch manifest.

According to Musk, the design of Starship\u2019s aerodynamic control surfaces and legs has changed since that 2018 update, but the leg that was delivered on August 18th certainly looks almost exactly like those pictured in official SpaceX media dated before Musk\u2019s reported changes.", "Just like official pre-steel renders from SpaceX, the delivered leg appears to have attachment points and hinges on its cylindrical end, while the bulk of the leg is tapered. Fascinatingly, the leg\u2019s exterior appears to have been constructed primarily via riveting steel, producing an aesthetic that screams \u201csteampunk spaceship\u201d.

That test also suffered a minor scrub on the 24th, followed by a successful flight one day later, a chapter that Starhopper may now mirror on its second attempted flight, a 150m (500 ft) hop.

The gist of the difficulties with Raptor\u2019s igniter starts with the reason that SpaceX is attempting to integrate an entirely new form of ignition into the engine, replacing the methods successfully used over tens or even hundreds of thousands of seconds of firing with the company\u2019s Merlin 1 and Merlin Vacuum engines.", "Merlin 1D and MVacD both rely on a relatively simple, reliable, cheap, and easy method of chemical ignition, using a duo of pyrophoric materials known as triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB).

Instead, Raptor uses those spark plugs ", "to ignite its ignition sources", ", what CEO Elon Musk has described as full-up blow torches. Once ignited, those blow torches \u2013 likely miniature rocket engines using the same methane and oxygen fuel as Raptor \u2013 then ignite the engine\u2019s methane and oxygen preburners before finally igniting those mixed, high-pressure gases in the combustion chamber.

Relative to Merlin 1D\u2019s TEA-TEB ignition, torch ignition \u2013 once optimized and matured into a reliable solution \u2013 will permit an almost unlimited number of Raptor ignitions before, during, and after flight. ", "Avoiding TEA-TEB and other complex chemical igniters also means that Starship will technically be able to launch to Mars or the Moon, perform injection and landing burns, maybe even hop around the surface, and still be able to return to Earth \u2013 all without resupply. Such a return voyage would still be predicated on the ability to generate the methane and oxygen propellant needed to fuel Starships, but \u2013 assuming that challenge can be solved \u2013 torch-lit Raptors would be ready for such a mission. In the event that, say, something like August 26th\u2019s scrub happens to a Starship on Mars, the crew would also be able to get out, inspect Starship\u2019s Raptors, and even replace faulty spark plugs if necessary.

The booster was likely departing SpaceX\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) launch facilities after some two months post-launch inspections and refurbishment, having completed its second launch and landing on June 12th, 2019 in support of the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM).", "Prior to its successful launch of RCM, B1051 had the historic privilege of supporting the inaugural orbital launch of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft, putting the next-gen crew capsule through its paces before a crewed launch debut expected to occur absolutely no earlier than (NET) December 2019. Known as DM-1 (Demo-1), B1051 was subjected to an exceptionally strenuous suite of inspections, analysis, and testing for the mission \u2013 from the very first welding sparks to the booster\u2019s McGregor, TX and Florida static fires and launch debut.

In the last 3-4 months, the (publicly visible) rate of rocket production has dramatically slowed, presumably an intentional slow-down triggered by SpaceX\u2019s rapidly growing fleet of flight-proven boosters.", "In the last four or so months, unaffiliated observers have spotted a grand total of one new Falcon 9 booster on its way from SpaceX\u2019s Hawthorne, CA factory to its McGregor, TX testing facilities.

Confirming initial reports from NASASpaceflight.com, Musk also stated that Starhopper\u2019s second flight will be its last, after which the steel rocket test-bed will be converted for stationary use at SpaceX\u2019s South Texas facilities.", "Prior to Musk tweeting that Starhopper may be nearing approval for its next flight, the SpaceX CEO revealed that delays were centered around the FAA\u2019s apparent unwillingness to permit the vehicle\u2019s next flight. Musk specifically stated that the FAA wanted more \u201chazard analysis\u201d, meaning that the US aviation administration had concerns that Starhopper could pose a serious threat to local residents in a tiny housing development known as Boca Chica Village.", "Technically speaking, Boca Chica Village is just 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away from SpaceX\u2019s Starhopper launch facilities, where the vehicle is expected to reach a maximum altitude of no more than 200m (650 ft) as early as August 26th. FAA regulations tend to be prescriptive and extremely rigid, understandable given the breadth of US aviation-related activities the agency is tasked with regulating. However, a basic back-of-the-envelope analysis of Starhopper\u2019s 200m hop suggests that the risk to local residents \u2013 even those as few as 1.5 miles away from the test \u2013 is minuscule. ", "Based on Starhopper\u2019s inaugural flight, its lone Raptor engine \u2013 producing up to 200 tons (450,000 lbf) of thrust \u2013 is not exactly capable of rapidly moving the Starship prototype. For all accounts and purposes, Starhopper is a spectacularly heavy hunk of steel with the aerodynamics of a cylindrical brick \u2013 capable of flight solely through the brute-force application of a literal rocket engine. To make it even half of the distance from its launch site to the Village, Starhopper would have to remain in controlled flight while radically deviating from its planned trajectory, all while its flight termination system (FTS) \u2013 explosives meant to destroy the vehicle in a worst-case scenario \u2013 completely fails to activate.", "As evidence of the apparent lack of perceived risk to local residents, Cameron County, Texas officials distributed flyers to Village residents advising \u2013 but not requiring \u2013 those choosing to remain at their homes during the test to ", "go outside", " during Starhopper\u2019s next flight. This is recommended to avoid flying glass in the event that the vehicle explodes, potentially shattering windows with the shockwave that could result, but clearly demonstrates the fact that county officials believe there is a near-zero chance of Starhopper actually impacting anywhere near the houses.", "Ultimately, Starhopper\u2019s limited flight tests clearly pose little to no actual risk to residents, but this chapter does raise a far more significant question: what happens once Starship Mk1 is ready and the flight tests SpaceX is pursuing involve distances and heights on the order of several, tens, or hundreds of kilometers? For now, answers will have to wait til a later date. ", "Aside from the delays and apparent lack of consensus on the safety of Starhopper\u2019s minor hop tests, Musk confirmed that the prototype\u2019s second test flight ever will likely be its last, providing some interesting insight into SpaceX\u2019s next steps. Most notably, the fact that SpaceX is willing and ready to fully retire Starhopper after such a limited test series serves as a fairly confident statement that orbital-class Starship Mk1 (Texas) and Mk2 (Florida) prototypes are extremely close to flight-readiness.", "Roughly a month ago, Musk tweeted that those Starship prototypes could be ready for their first flights as early as mid-September to mid-October, \u201c2 to 3 months\u201d from mid-July. In additional comments made on August 20th, Musk stated that his planned Starship presentation would be delayed in light of Starhopper\u2019s own delays, and is now instead expected to occur around a major Starship Mk1 integration milestone in \u201cmid September\u201d.", "As previously discussed on Teslarati, Starhopper\u2019s brief service life is entirely unsurprising, delayed by issues with Raptor engines to the point that SpaceX\u2019s far more valuable Starship prototypes \u2013 having made relentless progress \u2013 are already nearing completion. Once those Starships are ready for almost any kind of integrated testing, Starhopper will be made entirely and immediately redundant.", "\u201cAccording to Musk, either or both of those orbital-class prototypes could be ready for their inaugural flight tests as early as mid-September, perhaps just 1-2 months from now. Given that Starships Mk1 and Mk2 are significantly higher fidelity than Starhopper, the ungainly testbed will likely become redundant the moment that its successors are ready for flight. In other words, Starhopper is\u00a0fast\u00a0approaching the end of its useful life, and SpaceX\u2019s fight for a 200m hop-test permit could ultimately be a waste of time, effort, and money if said permit doesn\u2019t also cover Starship Mk1.\u201d", "Teslarati.com, August 20th, 2019", "On another positive note, CEO Elon Musk says that Starhopper won\u2019t be \u2018retired\u2019 to the scrapyard and will instead be lightly modified to serve as an in-situ test stand for Raptor engines, a useful addition once SpaceX South Texas moves on to multi-engine Starship and Super Heavy testing.", "With any luck, SpaceX will attempt to livestream Starhopper\u2019s second attempted flight.

As many have discovered, developing the ability to acquire, refine, and sell space resources is one of the most long-lead problems in existence. Put another way, funding a space exploration company on the promise of (or income from) space resources is a bit like paying for a solid-gold ladder by selling the fruit you needed it to reach.", "For such an enterprise to make economical sense, one must either have access to ladders that are cheaper than their weight in gold or be able to sell the harvested fruit at breathtaking premiums. The point of this analogy is to illustrate just how challenging, expensive, and immature deep space exploration is relative to the possible resources currently within its grasp. There is also a bit of a circular aspect to space resource utilization: to sell the resources at the extreme premiums needed to sustain their existence, there must be some sort of established market for those resources \u2013 ready to purchase them the moment they\u2019re available.

This is the exact thing that government space agencies like NASA should develop, but ", "entrenched and greedy corporate interests have effectively neutered NASA\u2019s ability to develop technology that might transcend the need for giant, ultra-expensive, expendable rockets.", "The need to secure funding via investors \u2013 investors expecting some sort of return \u2013 is the biggest roadblock to space resource utilization. Really, the only conceivable way to sustainably raise funding for space resource acquisition is to already have a functional and sustainable company as a base. SpaceX is a prime example: the company hopes to fund the development of a sustainable city on Mars with income from its launch business and Starlink internet constellation. ", "Given all of the above, it\u2019s extremely impressive that iSpace has managed to raise nearly $100M in just a few years and has done so without the involvement of one or several ultra-wealthy angel investors. Of course, it must still be acknowledged that the cost of iSpace\u2019s longer-term ambitions can easily be measured in the tens of ", "billions", " of dollars, but given an extremely lean operation and rapid success, $100M could plausibly fund at least one or two serious lunar landing attempts.

In the last year or so, the company has decided to entirely forgo that orbital test flight and instead plans to attempt a Moon landing on its first orbital flight, scheduled to launch on Falcon 9 no earlier than (NET) 2021.

Although SpaceX\u2019s rideshare proposal is far from revolutionary, the company\u2019s contract with Momentus Space appears to be more than a basic launch service agreement, potentially opening doors for far more flexible rideshare launches in the future.

The concept that has helped Momentus raise nearly $34M in just 1.5 years is relatively simple: build a spacecraft whose sole purpose is to propel other spacecraft to their final orbit(s). ", "Known as a space tug, the concept is about as old as practical spaceflight itself, and interest in actually developing the concept from paper to hardware has grown exponentially in the last 5-10 years, thanks in large part to an unprecedented boom in commercial spaceflight activity. Applied more specifically, modern efforts like Momentus tend to have ambitious goals couched behind much more achievable (and marketable) concepts.", "Momentus Space\u2019s first goal is to bridge the gap between the low cost of smallsat rideshare missions on large rockets and the convenience of smallsat launches on much smaller rockets by building lightweight, simple, and cheap orbital tugs.

If launched to a 600 km (370 mi) sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), Vigoride will be able to deliver as much as 220 kg (~500 lb) to a final circular orbit of ~1500 km (930 mi) or place 250 kg (550 lb) of satellites into 10+ separate orbits.", "By far the most innovative and potentially revolutionary aspect of Momentus\u2019 plans is its custom propulsion system of choice: water plasma rockets. In simple terms, Momentus space tugs would quite literally turn water and sunlight into a method of in-space propulsion that can offer both moderate efficiency and relatively high thrust. Using solar arrays, the space tug would charge batteries that would then power an extremely high-power microwave electrothermal thruster (MET). ", "In the case of Momentus, the exotic form of propulsion uses microwaves to almost instantaneously turn liquid water into plasma, an ionized, electrically-charged gas that can then be directed with a magnetic nozzle to produce thrust. Aside from the decent performance it offers, water-based MET allows a given satellite to completely avoid heavy pressure vessels, doesn\u2019t require extremely high voltages, and uses a fully non-toxic propellant (water). ", "The fact that pure water is so incredibly benign, non-toxic, and accessible opens up a realm of possibilities. Momentus already has plans to ", "launch Vigorides from the International Space Station", ", and that could eventually expand into actual in-space reuse in which water-powered satellites might dock with the ISS to load more water and pick up new payloads.", "In the case of SpaceX, it appears that the company has inked a more two-way agreement with Momentus, in the sense that prospective customers of SpaceX\u2019s Satellite Rideshare Program might actually be able to arrange for their satellites to be included on Vigoride.

Although the company has been dead silent as to the actual status of that prototype, even a failure would still serve as an invaluable learning opportunity, even if it would be an inconvenient setback.

Located in Mars\u2019 mid-northern latitudes, Arcadia Planitia \u2013 like its Latin namesake suggests \u2013 is a region of plains, specifically low plains per International Astronomical Union (IAU) standards.

This translates into much higher atmospheric pressure (i.e. a thicker atmosphere), insulating the region from some of the extremes of Martian weather, as does its relative adjacency to the planet\u2019s equator. Simultaneously, this wealth of atmosphere enables more efficient spacecraft landings. Per a September 2018 update, Starship is set to rely heavily on a series of atmospheric maneuvers to slow down, a strategy that significantly cuts the amount of propellant the spacecraft must use to land softly on Mars (and Earth!).", "To tally: Arcadia Planitia offers (somewhat) warmer summers and winters due to its latitude, augmented by a low relative altitude that insulates the region from weather extremes and enables more efficient propulsive spacecraft landings.", "However, perhaps more important than any of the above features is the fact that Arcadia Planitia is host to a vast wealth of water ice resources, ranging from frozen aquifers to glaciers in the adjacent Erebus Montes mountains.

Attached directly to a cryogenic fuel tank, Starhopper\u2019s seven-tile set was almost certainly meant to test methods of mounting a heat shield on a stainless steel tank. Those tiles went through several thermal cycles from propellant loading, spent weeks unprotected in hellish South Texas heat and humidity, and suffered through the shock of flight and a hard landing.", "The lone Raptor-adjacent tile was subjected to heating from a live engine just a dozen or so feet away, along with all the brutal acoustic stresses associated with it, perhaps including an unintended fire during anomalous engine performance.

Assuming that Raptor can somehow be ignited from standstill in less than a second (preferably 0.1-0.5s) and would still be able to ignite a second time for a soft landing, SpaceX could technically give Starship the thrust-to-weight ratio needed to quickly escape a Super Heavy failure by reducing the propellant load.

Put simply, rockets are in many ways far more complex than modern airliners, requiring margins of design and error and that would make commercial aircraft engineers blush. Modern FAA regulations currently expect manufacturers and operators to design, build, and fly passenger aircraft such that the chances of catastrophic failure (generally a fatal crash and total hull loss) average one in one billion flight hours. That may sound downright unachievable, but modern airliners routinely reach levels of reliability measured in hundreds of millions of flight hours between loss-of-life failures.

The only conceivable way to sustain a real commercial market for suborbital, hypersonic passenger transportation \u2013 aside from guaranteeing that passengers are unlikely to die \u2013 is to implement a level of rapid reusability that is entirely unprecedented in spaceflight.

This is undeniably a downgrade from \u201canywhere on Earth in less than an hour\u201d, but it would still easily trounce any existing mode of transport and could potentially lend itself to actual suborbital spaceports located in key areas.

For SpaceX, this may be the first time the company has ever attempted the feat \u2013 if any on-orbit testing has been done after completing customer missions, SpaceX has never commented on it. ", "Back in February 2018, Falcon Heavy\u2019s launch debut also happened to mark the first flight-test of a true long-duration upper stage coast and third ignition, a spectacular success that sent Starman and a Tesla Roadster into a heliocentric orbit that now reaches beyond Mars. As such, SpaceX will by no means be walking into the challenges of STP-2 unprepared. In fact, the coast required on Flight 1 may have technically been more challenging than any one of the four separate burns S2 will need to perform on STP-2. However, combining the need to do all four burns and deployments rather quickly and in sequence, the critical need for accurate orbital insertions, and high standards of reliability and mission assurance expected by the USAF, STP-2 will easily be the hardest mission SpaceX has yet to attempt.", "If SpaceX succeeds, the benefits will stretch far beyond simply satisfying an Air Force requirement and securing the USAF\u2019s Falcon Heavy certification. Once SpaceX has rigorously demonstrated the reliability of Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage for long coasts and high numbers of ignition events, the company will be able to apply that as a marketable product. Potential customers include the usual communications satellite operators desiring a direct-to-GEO insertion, saving time (and thus making money faster) by skipping the orbit-raising that comes with easier transfer orbits. ", "One major use-case \u2013 as demonstrated by Falcon Heavy\u2019s interplanetary launch debut \u2013 is sending payloads beyond Earth orbit, a capability that NASA would undoubtedly take advantage of. ", "But wait, there\u2019s more! In a predictable but still largely unexpected turn of events, the Air Force has also selected Falcon Heavy\u2019s STP-2 mission as an opportunity to gain familiarity with the rocket reusability SpaceX is famous for. Falcon Heavy\u2019s second mission and commercial launch debut \u2013 Arabsat 6A \u2013 used three all-new Block 5 boosters, two of which returned to land after gentle recoveries. Known as B1052 and B1053, the lightly-used boosters are now scheduled to become the first flight-proven orbital-class rockets launched on a Department of Defense (DoD) mission in 25 years, since the Space Shuttle\u2019s final military mission in 1992.", "If successful, SpaceX will help pave the way for the US military to seriously adopt reusable rockets and develop the \u201ccertification\u201d procedures needed to do so. This will benefit all prospective US launch providers, not just SpaceX, but SpaceX will likely be the only company flying valuable payloads on flight-proven rockets until Blue Origin and ULA\u2019s Vulcan achieve flight-proven certification for military launches. Much like regular certification often requires multiple launch demonstrations, flight-proven certification will likely be at least as \u2013 if not more \u2013 stringent. For New Glenn, that milestone might come as early as 2023-2025, while Vulcan \u2013 if a reusable engine section is ever actually implemented \u2013 is unlikely to even complete its launch debut \u2013 let alone first reuse \u2013 before 2025.", "As such, SpaceX is quite literally half a decade ahead of its prospective competitors when it comes to certifying flight-proven rockets for high-value launches. Additionally, just the act of the USAF completing its development of a reusability certification process will likely encourage \u2013 if not directly lay the foundation for \u2013 NASA to seriously consider doing the same with its own launch services.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

For unknown reasons, neither Raptor SN03 or SN04 are apparently ready to support flight operations, although both have been thoroughly hot-fired in McGregor. Perhaps each engine is a distinct prototype with a different level of experimental readiness, or perhaps SpaceX is just testing certain engines (like SN03) more extensively than others (SN05).

Already, the efficiency of recovery processing has gotten to the point that \u2013 once SpaceX optimizes Block 5\u2019s design for refurbishment-free reuse \u2013 there should be no logistical reason the company can\u2019t fly the same booster twice in ~24-48 hours.", "Rarely will it make headlines, but the fact remains that SpaceX\u2019s ultimate goal is not ", "just", " to reuse Falcon 9 (and other) boosters, but to do so with a level of routine efficiency approaching that of modern passenger aircraft. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that chemical rockets might never reach those capabilities, but they may certainly be able to improve enough to radically change the relationship between humans and spaceflight. ", "Along that line of thinking, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk decided years ago that an excellent representative goal for Falcon 9 would be to launch the same booster twice in 24 hours. In the last year or so, that largely arbitrary target has changed a bit and is now believed to be a bit wider, aiming for booster reuse within a few days of recovery. This is a pragmatic adjustment more than a technical criticism of Falcon 9.", "In general, Falcon 9 simply doesn\u2019t have the performance necessary for routine reusability timelines measured in hours. The majority of SpaceX launches need enough of Falcon 9\u2019s performance to necessitate recovery aboard one of SpaceX\u2019s two drone ships, typically stationed at least a 200-300 km (100-200 mi) offshore. That fact alone almost single-handedly kills any chance of sub-24-hour booster reuse, given that the process of towing the booster-carrying drone ship back to port happens at a max speed of ~10 mph (15 km/h). Just gaining permission to enter the port itself often involves waits of 6+ hours a few miles offshore. ", "Low orbit, low mass Falcon 9 missions are much more promising for extremely rapid reusability, given that both of SpaceX\u2019s West and East coast landing zones are located just a few miles (or less than 1500 feet, in the case of LZ-4) from their corresponding launch pads and processing facilities. However, these missions are quite rare, while SpaceX\u2019s own low Earth orbit (LEO) Starlink launches will likely involve payloads so heavy that long-distance drone ship recoveries will be necessary. ", "Finally, there are Falcon Heavy launches, most of which will allow for both side boosters to return to the Florida coast for landings at LZ-1/LZ-2. However, these pose their own barriers to rapid reuse, mainly due to the fact that side boosters \u2013 while technically just Falcon 9 boosters \u2013 would need major changes to support a single-stack Falcon 9 launch. Falcon Heavy launches simply aren\u2019t going to happen back-to-back over a period of 24-48 hours, so that option is also out of the question. ", "This means that SpaceX\u2019s only real option for practical rapid reuse is to instead focus on something closer to a weekly launch capability for Block 5 boosters, meaning that the same booster would be able to launch, land, return to shore, and prepare for the next launch in the same week. Even then, launch site readiness may still stand in the way of truly radical improvements in booster reuse and launch frequency. After each launch, SpaceX\u2019s pads and transporter/erectors take a significant beating, requiring routine repairs and maintenance before returning to flight-readiness. Barring major improvements, SpaceX has demonstrated minimum launch-to-launch times of roughly 10 days, and cutting that figure by 50-90% will be a major challenge for a rocket as powerful as Falcon 9. ", "Despite the many logistical reasons that Falcon 9 will likely never lend itself to routine ~24-hour reusability, having that latent capability would still mean that the hardware is advanced enough to offer that efficiency. Even if SpaceX can\u2019t literally fly each booster at its operational capacity, nearly refurbishment-free reflights will still translate into dramatically lower launch costs. Modern civilian aircraft need not fly every second of every day to still be affordable to operate (excluding amortization costs). ", "Ultimately, SpaceX has been taking small steps in that direction ever since the company began recovering (and reusing) Falcon 9 boosters.

However, whether it was motivated by conservatism, risk-aversion, or something else, Maxar and CSA likely have every contractual right to demand certain conditions, as long as they accept the consequences of those requirements. In the case of RCM, the customers accepted what they likely knew would be months of guaranteed delays to minimize something they perceived as a risk. ", "To some extent, it\u2019s hard to blame them. After going more than $400M over budget, the Maxar-built trio of upgraded Radarsat satellites are expected to end up costing more than $1 billion.

Admittedly, a year may feel like a huge amount of time, but SpaceX has demonstrated just how hard the reliably successful recovery of orbital-class rocket hardware really is.

Excluding helicopter-based fairing drop tests, Mr. Steven and SpaceX\u2019s fairing recovery team have made five attempts to catch fairings in the vessel\u2019s net after Falcon 9 launches.

", "In January 2019, Mr. Steven sailed ~8000 km (5000 mi) from Port of Los Angeles to Port Canaveral, passing through the Panama Canal. For unknown reasons, during a trip out to sea to catch a Falcon 9 fairing in February, Mr. Steven abruptly turned around early and arrived in port missing two of four arms, four of eight booms, and the entirety of its custom net. The remaining arms/booms were removed and the vessel spent roughly three months docked with just a handful of excursions.

Mr. Steven has yet to venture beyond the safety of Port Canaveral since its new \u2018catcher\u2019s mitt\u2019 was installed, but SpaceX has been testing the new setup by repeatedly lowering a Falcon fairing half into the net. It\u2019s too early to raise expectations but it seems plausible that the iconic recovery vessel will be ready to attempt its first fairing catch in ~4 months as part of Falcon Heavy\u2019s next scheduled launch, currently NET June 22.", "Although Mr. Steven\u2019s prospects look better than they have in months, SpaceX\u2019s fairing recovery engineers and technicians have not been sitting on their hands. Begun as a check against the growing possibility that reliably catching fairings in a (relatively) small net is just too difficult to be worth it, SpaceX has been analyzing methods of reusing fairings without Mr. Steven. Most notably, despite the failure to catch fairings out of the air, the fairing halves themselves \u2013 relying on GPS-guided parafoils \u2013 have proven to be capable of reliably performing gentle landings on the ocean surface. ", "This consistently leaves the fairings intact and floating on the ocean but at the cost of partial saltwater immersion and exposure to surface-level sea spray and waves. At least in today\u2019s era of highly complex large satellites, customers typically demand that payload fairings (like Falcon 9\u2019s) offer a clean room-quality environment once the satellite is encapsulated inside. Sea water is full of salt, organic molecules, and water, all three of which do not get along well with extremely sensitive electronics. The whole purpose of recovering and reusing fairings is to make their reuse more efficient and less expensive than simply building a new fairing. The task of cleaning composite structures to clean room-standards after salt water exposure and immersion tends to be less than friendly to both aspirations. ", "According to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, however, that challenge may be distinctly solvable and could even be easier than the Mr. Steven approach. After Falcon Heavy\u2019s commercial Arabsat 6A launch debut in April 2019, Musk again confirmed that SpaceX would be ready to test that alternate method of fairing reuse very soon and plans to do so on an \u201cinternal\u201d (i.e. Starlink) launch later this year. As noted below, this is helped by the fact that SpaceX\u2019s internally-developed Starlink satellites apparently have no need for the acoustic insulation panels that normally protect sensitive spacecraft from the brutal acoustic environment produced by rockets while still in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "For fairing reusability, the lack of those panels is just one less thing to have to worry about cleaning or replacing. Intriguingly, it\u2019s easy to imagine that \u2013 much like SpaceX has apparently designed Starlink satellites to be resistant to intense acoustic environments \u2013 the company could have also required that they be tough enough to tolerate a less-than-pristine fairing environment. With that approach, SpaceX could continue to build new fairings for every customer launch, entirely amortizing their production cost before transferring the \u2018dirty\u2019, flight-proven fairings to internal Starlink launches. ", "In essence, SpaceX\u2019s customers would quite literally be paying the company to build the very Falcon 9 boosters and fairings it will ultimately use to launch its massive Starlink constellation, requiring hundreds of launches over the next decade. The faster and more efficiently SpaceX can build and launch Starlink, the faster it can develop Starship/Super Heavy and entirely transcend any concerns of salty fairings (let alone expendable upper stages).

With this likely acquisition, nearly all of SpaceX\u2019s non-drone ship vessels are now leased from \u2013 and partially operated by \u2013 GO. The name change is undeniably bittersweet for those that have been following Mr. Steven\u2019s fairing recovery journey from the beginning.

Two days later, Ms. Tree arrived back at Port Canaveral. Another 24 hours after that, the intact, dry fairing half was safely lifted onto land and transported to a local SpaceX facility dedicated to analyzing (and eventually refurbishing) recovered Falcon fairings. ", "With any luck, the successful catch will prove that the years of work have been worth it, demonstrating that fairing halves caught \u2013 rather than fished out of the ocean \u2013 are structurally sound and clean enough to be quickly and affordably reused. While Falcon fairings have been estimated to take up less than 10% of the material cost of Falcon 9 production (~$6M, $3M/half), the manufacturing apparatus needed to build them takes up a huge amount of space. Additionally, the process of oven-curing huge, monolithic carbon fiber fairings introduces fundamental constraints that physically limit how quickly they can be built. ", "Fairing reuse would be an invaluable benefit for SpaceX\u2019s internal Starlink launches, of which dozens and \u2013 eventually \u2013 hundreds will be needed to build an operational constellation of satellites. Thanks to the wonders of Falcon 9 Block 5 booster reuse, the internal cost of a flight-proven booster is essentially just the cost of refurbishment and then the propellant and work-hours needed to launch it. What remains is the cost of the expendable Falcon upper stage (unlikely to be recovered or reused) and payload fairing, now reasonably consistent at landing intact on the ocean surface but yet to demonstrate practical reusability.", "As proposed, SpaceX\u2019s completed Starlink constellation represents almost 12,000 satellites. Assuming no progress is made with packing density, no larger payload fairing is developed, and Starship doesn\u2019t reach orbit until the mid-2020s (admittedly unlikely), Starlink will require almost exactly 200 Falcon 9 launches, each carrying 60 satellites. According to Musk, despite the fact that the first 60 satellites launched were effectively advanced prototypes, the cost of launch is already more than the cost of satellite production.", "Speaking at a conference in 2017, Musk noted that payload fairings cost about $6M to produce, roughly 10% of Falcon 9\u2019s $62M list price. In 2013, Musk stated that the first stage represented less than 75% of the overall cost of Falcon 9 production, meaning that the rocket\u2019s upper stage probably represents another 15-20% (call it a 70:20:10 split), or ~$9-12M. Conservatively assuming that the operating costs of Falcon 9 refurbishment, launch, and recovery are roughly $5M per mission, the internal cost to SpaceX for a launch with a recoverable flight-proven booster and an expended fairing and upper stage could be just $20-25M and may be even lower. ", "For reference, assuming 200 Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX could save nearly $600M by consistently recovering and reusing just one fairing half on average per launch, up to as much as $1.2B if both halves can be consistently recovered and reused.

Pushed to the limits, a complete Rutherford engine can be printed and assembled in as few as 24 hours.", "Currently, Rocket Lab is producing an Electron booster every 20-30 days and flies about once a month out of New Zealand. Since the first operational flight at the end of 2018 Rocket Lab has supported both commercial and government payloads. With a new launch complex (LC-2) coming online in Wallops, Virgina by the end of this year, they look to increase launch frequency, but also widen its market of customers. According to CEO Peter Beck, booster reuse could be a boon for Electron\u2019s launch cadence.", "In the world of aerospace, SpaceX is effectively the only private spaceflight company (or entity of any kind) able to launch, land, and reuse orbital-class rockets, although other companies and space agencies have also begun to seriously pursue similar capabilities. Rocket Lab\u2019s announcement certainly brings newfound interest to the private rocket launch community. Reuse of launch vehicle boosters \u2013 typically the largest and most expensive portion of any given rocket \u2013 is a fundamental multiplier for launch cadence and can theoretically decrease launch costs under the right conditions.", "Rocket Lab hopes, more than anything, that recoverability will lead to an increase in their launch frequency and \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 a doubling of the functional production capacity of the company\u2019s established Electron factory space. This will allow for more innovation and give the company more opportunities to \u201cchange the industry and, quite frankly, change the world,\u201d according to founder and CEO Peter Beck.", "Unlike like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, propulsive landing is not an option for the small Electron rocket. In fact, cost-effective recovery and reuse of vehicles as small as Electron was believed to be so difficult that Beck long believed (and openly stated) that Rocket Lab would never attempt the feat. Beck claims that in order to land a rocket on its end propulsively \u2013 by using engines to slow the booster while it hurdles back to Earth in the way the Falcon 9 booster does \u2013 would mean that their small rocket would have to scale up into the medium class of rockets. As Beck stated, \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of building medium-sized launch vehicles. We\u2019re in the business of building small launch vehicles for dedicated customers to get to orbit frequently.\u201d\u00a0", "The main concern that Rocket Lab faces with the daunting task of not using propulsion to land is counteracting the immense amount of energy that the Electron will encounter on its return trip through the atmosphere. In order to return the booster in any sort of reusable condition they will have to decrease the amount of energy that the rocket is encountering which presents in the forms of heat and pressure from ~8 times the speed of sound to around 0.01 times the speed of sound. This decrease also needs to occur in around 70 seconds during re-entry and according to Beck \u201cthat\u2019s a really challenging thing to do.\u201d Beck went on further to explain that this really converts into dissipating about 3.5 gigajoules of energy which is enough energy to power ~57,000 homes.\u00a0", "When re-entering the atmosphere the energy that any spacecraft endures creates shockwaves of plasma which must be diverted away in order to protect the integrity of the spacecraft. An example of this ", "can be seen during the re-entry of a SpaceX fairing half", ". Beck explains that \u201cthe plasma around those shockwaves is equal to about half the temperature of the (surface of the) sun\u201d which can reach temperatures as high as 6,000 degrees fahrenheit. It also endures aerodynamic pressure equal to that of three elephants stacked on top of the Electron, according to Beck. His team refers to these challenges as breaking through \u201cThe Wall.\u201dBeck explains that they will attempt to solve these problems differently using passive measures and aerodynamic decelerators.\u00a0", "The Wall is something that Beck and his team have been trying to tackle for some time now. Since the Electron began operational flights at the end of 2018 data has been collected to inform the problem solving process. In total Electron has successfully completed 7 flights, with its 8th scheduled to occur within the coming days. Beck explains that flights 6 and 7 featured data collection done through 15,000 different collection channels on board of Electron. The upcoming eighth flight will feature an advanced data recording system nicknamed Brutus. This new recording system will accompany Electron on the descent, but will survive while the booster breaks up as usual. It will then be collected and the data will be evaluated and used to further inform the decision making process for how to best help Electron survive its fall back to Earth.", "Once Rocket Lab breaks through The Wall and effectively returns Electron without harm, the booster will need to be collected before splashing down into corrosive saltwater. This was demonstrated to be done via helicopter which according to Beck is \u201csuper easy.\u201d", "An animation depicts a helicopter leaving a dedicated recovery vessel to capture the Electron booster after it deploys a parafoil and begins gliding. The helicopter will intercept the booster\u2019s parachute using a hook and will then carry the booster back to the recovery vessel, where technicians will carefully secure it.", "The entire goal of recovering a booster is to be able to reuse it quickly. Beck explains that since Electron is an \u201celectric turbopump vehicle\u2026in theory, we should be able to put it back on the pad, charge the batteries up, and go again.\u201d", "Although this goal is ambitious, it is one that \u2013 if achieved \u2013 will significantly impact the launch community in very positive ways. Not only will the option of rapid reusability open up, but so will opportunity for more agencies to engage in the world of satellite deployment. The Electron currently costs anywhere between $6.5 \u2013 7 million per launch to fly. If the production cost of a new booster is removed space becomes attainable for many more customers.

For example, the helmets Behnken and Hurley are seen wearing use 3D printing to integrate extremely complex life support systems, a built-in microphone and speaker communications array, a seamless multi-hinged visor, and more.\u00a0", "The suits are also designed to allow for easy maneuverability and a seamless user experience within the Dragon capsule.\u00a0The attached gloves of the suit use conductive leather to allow the astronauts to interact with the Crew Dragon\u2019s primary controls, a set of large touchscreens.  Apple iPads will additionally be mounted directly on the thighs of the astronauts to serve as an even more convenient (and redundant) method of interfacing with Dragon\u2019s controls, among other things. ", "While the suits are designed to be pressurized to support the astronauts in the event of a life-threatening event that may occur aboard Dragon, they are not meant for spacewalks or prolonged exposure to the vacuum of space.

Having the opportunity to run through a launch day dress rehearsal allows everyone in the process to become familiarized with the specialized procedures that will occur ahead of boarding the Dragon capsule. ", "Unlike previous crewed NASA launches, SpaceX plans to have astronauts board Crew Dragon before launch vehicle fueling begins. This new approach to crew loading has become known as \u201cLoad-and-Go.\u201d This procedure is extremely familiar to SpaceX, as the company supercools the liquid oxygen and kerosene propellant used by Falcon 9 and Heavy to significantly improve the performance of both rockets.

One way or another, SpaceX now has a pair of Port Canaveral-based fairing recovery ships in hand \u2013 named Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief \u2013 and is thus making excellent progress towards catching and reusing both halves of the same Falcon 9 (or Heavy) fairing. ", "Put simply, whoever is paying for or has paid for the two fast supply vessels (FSVs) that are now a part of SpaceX\u2019s rocket recovery fleet has/had a tidy sum to spend. For ships as large, new, and high-performance as Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief, both completed in the mid-2010s, SpaceX or GO would be lucky to pay less than $10M apiece and each ship could easily cost more than $20M, depending on a variety of unknowns. Previous owner Seatran Marine is/was admittedly in dire financial straits, so that could have resulted in an effective fire-sale discount.", "Regardless, this is to say that SpaceX was likely willing to splurge and open its wallet wide for extremely high-quality fairing recovery vessels because of just how expensive those fairings are. According to CEO Elon Musk circa 2017, it costs SpaceX $5-6M total to produce a set of Falcon fairing halves, equivalent to roughly 10% of the cost of a Falcon 9 launch ($50M-60M).", "As an example, assume that SpaceX paid a full $50M for Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief \u2013 effectively a worst-case cost scenario. Assume that recovering and reusing net-caught Falcon fairings still costs half as much as building new fairings ($3M for two halves), also likely a worst-case scenario given the relative mechanical and propulsive simplicity of fairings. ", "In this mediocre-at-best scenario, it would still take SpaceX less than 20 launches with both halves recovered to completely recoup the cost of both fairing recovery ships. In the event that reusing caught fairings is only 25% as expensive as building new fairings, SpaceX could recoup its fleet investments in just 10 launches. In fact, cost reduction may even be a secondary consideration next to the potential for effectively doubling fairing production with the same facilities. From that perspective, spending, say, $50M on development and another $50M on cutting-edge recovery vessels could easily be a bargain, especially compared to the $1B+ SpaceX has spent deloping Falcon 9 booster reusability.", "With GO Ms. Chief\u2019s August 10th arrival at Port Canaveral, SpaceX\u2019s team of Florida-based recovery engineers and technicians will now be tasked with modifying the ship for Falcon fairing catching. SpaceX completed its first fairing recovery-focused modifications back in late 2017, likely producing what was the first version of fairing recovery tech (Mk1).

Perhaps most importantly, it confirms \u2013 barring a surprise launch contract or internal Starlink mission \u2013 that Falcon Heavy\u2019s next (and fourth) launch is unlikely to occur until late next year, a gap of at least 15-17 months.", "Announced roughly four months after Falcon Heavy\u2019s inaugural February 2018 launch debut, the USAF contracted with SpaceX to launch the ~6350 kg (14,000 lb) AFSPC-52 satellite no earlier than (NET) September 2020. In February 2019, Department of Defense contract announcements revealed that SpaceX had been awarded three military launch contracts, two for the National Reconnaissance Office (NROL-85 & NROL-87) and one for the USAF (AFSPC-44), all tentatively scheduled to launch in 2021.", "First reported by Spaceflight Now, Col.

That could theoretically change, especially if SpaceX has plans to launch the massive rocket in support of an internal Starlink mission or even something more exotic, but the loss of both Block 5 center core B1055 and B1057 means that the company will have to build an entirely new center core.", "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy lead times are far superior to competitor ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy production line, but the process of manufacturing new center cores is still quite lengthy. Critically, Falcon Heavy Block 5 center cores require strengthened octawebs, custom interstages, and propellant tanks that are significantly thicker than those used on Falcon 9. For all intents and purposes, a center core is a totally different rocket relative to a Falcon 9 booster, the latter being SpaceX\u2019s primary focus at the company\u2019s assembly line-style Hawthorne factory. It\u2019s theoretically possible for a dedicated Falcon Heavy center core build to be expedited or leapfrogged forward in the production queue, but most long-lead Falcon 9 booster hardware physically cannot be redirected to speed up center core production.", "Unless SpaceX was already in the process of building a new center core prior B1057\u2019s unsuccessful landing attempt, it\u2019s safe to assume that the next custom Falcon Heavy booster is unlikely to be completed until early 2020, if not later. In theory, this means that Falcon Heavy could be dormant for no less than 16 months between STP-2 and its next launch. Traditionally, that sort of lengthy gap between launches has been frowned upon by NASA, ULA, and oversight groups like GAO. If a given rocket doesn\u2019t launch for a year or more, it can potentially pose a risk to reliability and raise costs as its production and launch teams have no satisfactory way to fully preserve their technical expertise.

In fact, at one point, NASA hoped to require its ", "Space Launch System (SLS) rocket be able to launch no less than once per year", ", partly motivated by a desire to mitigate some of the deterioration that can follow extremely low launch cadences. Years later, financial constraints and years upon years of delays and budget overruns have made such a cadence effectively impossible for SLS/Orion, but the fact remains that launching a rocket just once every 18-24 months is likely to inflate both costs and risks. ", "Thankfully, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy could scarcely be more different than NASA\u2019s SLS and the retired Space Shuttle it derives most of its hardware from. Even if all things are held equal and not flying a Falcon Heavy center core for 16+ months increases risk and cost, center cores are still heavily derived from Falcon 9 booster technology, including plumbing, avionics, attitude control thrusters, Merlin 1D engines, landing legs, and launch facilities. ", "Furthermore, the center core is just one of five distinct assemblies that make up a given Falcon Heavy. Both side boosters are effectively Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters with nose cones instead of interstages and slight modifications to support booster attachment hardware, while the upper stage and payload fairing are the same for all Falcon launches. In other words, SpaceX\u2019s workforce will continue to build, launch, land, and reuse dozens of Falcon 9 boosters \u2013 as well as upper stages payload fairings \u2013 between now and Falcon Heavy Flight 4, even if it\u2019s NET Q4 2020. In a worst-case scenario, SpaceX production and launch staff will be unfamiliar and inexperienced with maybe 20% of Falcon Heavy \u2013 at least in a very rough sense.

With any luck, work on orbital Starship assembly and integration has already resumed following the small July 8th fire.

SpaceX can technically compete in the ~30 launch contract competition to follow, but the company wouldn\u2019t receive a penny of development funding to meet the same requirements its competitors are being paid hundreds of millions of dollars for. In lieu of this undeniable imbalance, SpaceX \u2013 via Congressman Adam Smith \u2013 secured language in the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act that would provide the company $500M (equivalent to Blue Origin\u2019s award) if they win one of Phase 2\u2019s two block-buy contracts.", "Despite the fact that the USAF has plans to spend more than $2B assisting the development of three new rockets, LSA Phase 2 procurement has been inexplicably structured in such a way that only two companies/rockets can win, with one receiving 60% of contracts and the other receiving 40%. In other words, with that baffling award structure and under the assumption that SpaceX wins one of the slots, two of the three rockets the USAF is throwing money at will either die on the drawing board (Omega) or have a significantly lower chance of achieving military launch certification (New Glenn).", "Ultimately, it\u2019s clear that building an entirely new fairing would be valuable for SpaceX, even if it might be extremely expensive and of dubious strategic merit alongside the simultaneously development of Starship/Super Heavy, a vehicle that will feature a reusable 9m-diameter payload bay.

", "Hosted by SpaceX Vice President of Mission Assurance Hans Koenigsmann and NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Kathy Lueders, the call provided some minor additional insight beyond a fairly extensive press release issued just prior. According to the preliminary results from SpaceX\u2019s failure investigation, Crew Dragon\u2019s explosion was unrelated to the spacecraft\u2019s propellant tanks, Draco maneuvering thrusters, or SuperDraco abort engines. Rather, the cause lies in a more exotic and unanticipated chemical/material interaction between a plumbing valve, liquid oxidizer, and a helium-based pressurization system.", "According to Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX is approximately 80% of the way through what is known as the fault tree, essentially meaning that the failure investigation is 80% complete. That additional 20% could certainly throw some curveballs but the SpaceX executive was fairly confident that the results presented on July 15th would be representative of the final conclusion. ", "The ultimate (likely) cause of Crew Dragon\u2019s extremely energetic and destructive explosion centers around the spacecraft\u2019s extensive SuperDraco/Draco plumbing and its associated pressurization system, which uses helium to keep the pressure-fed engines, propellant tanks, and feed lines around 2400 psi (16.5 megapascals). Necessarily, this method of pressurization means that there is direct contact between the pressurant (helium) and the oxidizer/fuel, thus requiring some sort of valve preventing the pressurized fluid from flowing into the pressurization system.", "During flight-proven Crew Dragon capsule C201\u2019s April 20th static fire testing, that is reportedly exactly what happened. Over the course of ground testing, a \u201ccheck valve\u201d separating the pressurization system and oxidizer leaked what SpaceX described as a \u201cslug\u201d of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer (NTO) into the helium pressurization lines. Around T-100 milliseconds to a planned ignition of the vehicle\u2019s 8 SuperDraco abort engines, the pressurization system rapidly \u201cinitialized\u201d (i.e. quickly pressurized the oxidizer and fuel to operational pressures, ~2400 psi). ", "To do this, helium is rapidly pushed through a check valve \u2013 designed with low-molecular-mass helium in mind \u2013 to physically pressurize the propellant systems. Unintentionally, the NTO that leaked \u2018upstream\u2019 through that valve effectively was taken along for the ride with the high-pressure burst of helium. In essence, picture that you crash your car, only to discover that your nice, fluffy airbag has accidentally been replaced with a bag of sand, and you might be able to visualize the unintended forces Dragon\u2019s check valve (the metaphorical airbag) was subjected to when a \u201cslug\u201d of dense oxidizer was rammed into it at high speed.", "In itself, this sort of failure mode is not hugely surprising and SpaceX may have even been aware of some sort of check valve leak(s) and accepted what it believed to be a minor risk in order to continue the test and perhaps examine Dragon\u2019s performance under suboptimal conditions. What SpaceX says it did not realize was just how energetic the reaction between the NTO and the check valve could be. SpaceX\u2019s understanding is that the high-speed slug of dense NTO was traveling so fast and at such a high pressure that, by impacting the titanium check valve, it quite literally broke the valve and may have chemically ignited the metal, thus introducing a slug of burning NTO into the liberated NTO system itself \u2013 effectively a match tossed into a powder keg. ", "It\u2019s unclear if the ignition came from a chemical reaction between titanium (a technically flammable metal similar to magnesium) and NTO, or if the source came from the titanium valve being smashed apart, perhaps quite literally creating a spark as metal debris violently interacted. Either way, the solution \u2013 as SpaceX perceives it \u2013 is the same: instead of a mechanical check valve (simple but still not 100% passive), the barrier between pressurant and oxidizer (as well as fuel, most likely) will be replaced with something known as a burst disk. According to Koenigsmann, only a handful (~4) of those valves exist and thus need to be replaced by burst disks, a relatively fast and easy fix.", "Burst disks are single-use and inherently unreusable, but they are also completely passive and simply do not leak until subjected to a specific amount of pressure. Because they are single-use, they can\u2019t be directly tested prior to flight, limiting some of the in-principle reliability for the sake of an extremely leak-proof barrier.", "Ultimately, both Koenigsmann and Lueders went out of their way to avoid answering any questions about SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon upcoming test and launch schedule and what sort of delays the explosion will ultimately incur. Both individuals were nevertheless upbeat and by the sound of it, delays to Crew Dragon will be far less severe relative to delays caused by a pressure vessel or engine failure. For the time being, NASA has published a tentative target of mid-November 2019 for Crew Dragon\u2019s first crewed launch to the International Space Station, while Lueders and Koenigsmann expressed hope in a 2019 launch but refused to give a specific estimate of the odds of that occurring.

According to the vehicle\u2019s circa. 2018 dimensions, it will stretch 55m (180 ft) from nose to tail, be 9m (30 ft) in diameter, and weigh (per 2017 specs) ~85 tons (190,000 lb) empty and upwards of ~1350 tons (2.95 million lbs) fully fueled.

", "Aside from the mass of Starship, there is also the question of how to gently land the spacecraft in the first place. Lunar gravity is roughly 1/6th of Earth\u2019s, meaning that, say, 200 tons (i.e. Raptor\u2019s thrust) would equate to more than 1200 tons of effective thrust on the Moon, a more than 10:1 thrust-to-weight ratio. For reference, the Apollo Lunar Module descent stage was powered by an engine with ~10,000 lbf (4.5 tons) of thrust that could throttle as low as ~1000 lbf (0.45 tons), meaning that even in lunar gravity conditions, the LM could have a thrust-to-weight ratio less than 1. For the purpose of safely landing on the Moon and ensuring a gentle landing, that is an extremely desirable thing to have. ", "Much like Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage features cold-gas nitrogen thrusters to settle its propellant before MVac ignition, Starship will likely need a similar system, and it\u2019s possible that that system could be used to gently land Starship and tweak its velocity in the final stages of a Moon landing. This study will likely be used in part to figure out what exactly the optimal method of landing Starship is.", "Finally, SpaceX\u2019s second NASA SAA focuses on developing the immature technology of in-orbit propellant transfer, an absolute necessity for Starship to simultaneously be fully reusable and capable of landing significant payloads on other planets (or moons). Ever since SpaceX CEO Elon Musk first revealed the company\u2019s Mars-bound launch vehicle in 2016, it has incorporated in-orbit refueling as a foundational feature. ", "Due to the additions required for full reusability, Starship will essentially need to be launched into Earth orbit and then quickly refueled anywhere from 1 to 10+ times depending on the ultimate destination and the mass of the cargo being delivered. This is not to say that Starship will be useless without refueling \u2013 according to SpaceX VP of Sales Jonathan Hofeller, Starship will be capable of launching more than 100 tons (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit and 20 tons (44,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), more than enough to satisfy every commercial demand currently in existence.", "However, with one or several refueling missions, Starship should be able to turn 100 tons to LEO into 100 tons to the surface of Mars or dozens of tons to the surface of the Moon.

Practically speaking, between SpaceX\u2019s Pad 39A and LC-40 launch facilities, the company could easily maintain a biweekly or even weekly cadence (13-26 launches in H2 2019).

New center cores can and will be produced and there should be no doubt that SpaceX will eventually perfect center core recovery (or transcend the need entirely with Starship).", "As noted by both CEO Elon Musk and several SpaceX engineers-turned-webcast-hosts, aside from the fact that the overall mission was by far the company\u2019s most challenging yet, center core B1057\u2019s recovery was also expected to be the most challenging booster landing ever.

However, based on basic info that was included in the webcast, B1057 completed its boost burn and separated from the upper stage and Space Test Program-2 (STP-2) payload some 3 minutes and 40 seconds after lifting off from Pad 39A. At MECO (main-engine cutoff), the building-sized booster was traveling a blistering 3.1 km/s (Mach 9) at an altitude of more than 120 km (75 mi).", "Running on slim propellant margins, the booster coasted through vacuum almost the entire way to drone ship OCISLY. Around 9 minutes after launch, B1057 began its entry burn, likely igniting three Merlin 1D engines to effectively cushion it against the worst of atmospheric reentry heating. Unintuitively, much of the actual benefit of that burn derives from that cushioning effect, while the burn only slows the booster down by a few hundred meters per second (mph). ", "Effectively falling in near-vacuum conditions, pulled by gravity, B1057 could easily have been traveling 3.5-4 km/s (Mach 10-12) by the time Earth\u2019s atmosphere began to slow it down. Described by Musk himself, back-of-the-envelope analysis of available telemetry apparently indicated that that spectacularly fast and hot reentry either burned through B1057\u2019s heavy titanium heat shield or broke through the smaller heat shield surrounding its M1D engine bells. ", "In short, the brutal heating and buffeting of hypersonic atmospheric reentry damaged the rocket\u2019s central M1D engine, necessary for an accurately controlled drone ship landing. Incredibly, B1057 actually appeared to make it almost all the way to a successful recovery, veering off course just a few hundred meters above OCISLY.

Looks can certainly be deceiving but SpaceX\u2019s Florida Starship prototype \u2013 while undeniably flying through preliminary assembly \u2013 does not appear to be anywhere near flight-readiness. In Boca Chica, a partially separate SpaceX team is working to prepare Starhopper \u2013  a partial-fidelity, suborbital prototype \u2013 for low-altitude, low-velocity hop tests", "Back in May, a mystery Raptor engine \u2013 believed to be serial number 04 (SN04 \u2013 appeared in South Texas and was soon installed on Starhopper for fit-checks and tests of the engine\u2019s thrust vectoring capabilities. SN04 was soon uninstalled and shipped elsewhere; perhaps to SpaceX\u2019s rapidly-progressing Florida Starship. If the surprise Florida Raptor is, in fact, SN04, then it\u2019s safe to assume that it will remain inert for the time being, serving as a fit-check article and opportunity for training and familiarizing technicians and build engineers. At the moment, Florida\u2019s Starship lies in several large segments, including what appears to be the early stages of its first propellant tank bulkhead(s). ", "Nevertheless, as partially demonstrated above, SpaceX\u2019s Florida team is wasting no time at all. By all appearances, they are rapidly catching up with Texas, at least as long as Boca Chica\u2019s Starhopper work is excluded. Given the benefit of the doubt, SpaceX Texas would likely be at a similar stage of Starship develop after a similar amount of time (~2-3 months), but much of the Boca Chica workforce has been focused intently on building, upgrading, and testing Starhopper, essentially a flying testbed for Raptor and BFR development.", "To an extent, Florida\u2019s orbital Starship prototype looks even more refined than its relatively rugged Texas cousin. Given an additional 1-2 months of nonstop work and a rate of progress similar to the last two months, it\u2019s not out of the question that the Florida prototype will begin to seriously resemble a finished Starship. By all realistic accounts, some of the most difficult work will be found inside and around Starship\u2019s finished aeroshell, though, and the process of outfitting avionics, plumbing the propellant/propulsion sections, and implementing hydraulic/actuation systems will be a huge amount of work. ", "Even after Starship East is effectively complete, SpaceX will still face the seemingly immense challenge of transporting a massive spacecraft that weighs several dozen tons and measures 9m (30 ft) in diameter and 60m (200 ft) tall from Cocoa to Pad 39A, a full 20-30 miles of public roads and highways. In fact, the easiest method of transporting may involve getting Starship onto a barge in the nearby Indian River and towing it 100+ miles by water to the beach adjacent to Pad 39A.

While relatively minor in the scope full Falcon 9 booster reuse, in-situ leg retraction could save SpaceX days of recovery and preflight work, a big help for truly rapid reusability.", "A handful of prior retraction attempts have been made on Block 5 boosters but unknown issues prevented the process from taking hold. With some modifications to the legs and their deployment/retraction mechanisms, SpaceX seems to have solved those issues and is ready to graduate to a new level of rapid and easy rocket reusability. Teslarati photographer Tom Cross was on site in Port Canaveral, Florida when SpaceX began its first operational leg retractions and was able to capture photos and videos of the process.", "The crux of the need for a relatively complex crane-and-jig method of leg retraction rests on SpaceX\u2019s landing leg design. Put simply, after rapidly deploying with a combination of gravity and hydraulics, Falcon 9 landing legs have no built-in way to return to their stowed state. Each of the four legs are quite large, weighing around 600 kg (1300 lb) and stretching about 10m (33 ft) from hinge to tip. They use an intricate telescoping carbon fiber deployment mechanism to give the legs enough strength to stand up to the forces of Falcon 9 booster landings.", "Combined, the legs\u2019 size and telescoping mechanism makes the addition of an onboard retraction mechanism impractical. All the needed hardware would struggle to find a good place for installation and would quite literally be dead weight during launches and landings, stealing from Falcon 9/Heavy payload capacity and generally serving no purpose until a booster has been lifted off the ground with a giant crane.  ", "As a result, SpaceX engineers instead decided to separate leg retraction hardware from the rocket itself and designed a custom crane jig. Pictured above, the jig attaches to Falcon 9\u2019s interstage and allows the crane operator to lift the entire booster as needed. It also features four independent motors and pulleys that are meant to attach to a specific port on the outside of each booster landing leg. The jig then lifts the landing legs up, nominally retracting the telescoping deployment mechanism, at which point latches should be able to safely secure the legs to the booster\u2019s body. ", "This has been significantly more difficult than expected, judging from a number of retraction attempts over the past six or so months. Falcon 9 Block 5 debuted in May 2018 \u2013 in fact, almost exactly one year ago \u2013 and SpaceX has since built 11 boosters that have supported 15 launches. SpaceX has thus taken ~12 months to get to a point where Falcon 9\u2019s landing legs can be safely retracted, perhaps owing more to the fact that said legs are of minimal monetary value relative to the rest of a recovered booster. Improving leg retractibility is a bit of a luxury in that sense, as retracting legs offers little value proposition in terms of significantly lowering the cost of launch or reuse. ", "What leg retraction does do, however, is shave a significant amount of time off of the process of booster recovery and post-recovery processing. Instead of the normal process of totally dismantling and removing the legs piece by piece, stowing Falcon 9\u2019s legs saves not only the time it takes to remove them but also the time it then takes to reinstall said legs for the next launch. At a minimum, this could save 12-24 hours of dedicated work, up to as much as several days according to CEO Elon Musk. Taken to the extreme, it\u2019s likely that SpaceX\u2019s ultimate goal is to lift a booster off the drone ship, retract its landing legs mid-air (or close), flip the booster horizontal, and lower it onto a transporter in one fluid movement. ", "If SpaceX can arrive at something approximating that in the near future, the company will be well on its way accomplish Musk\u2019s goal of launching the same Falcon 9 booster twice in ~24 hours. Even further down the road, if or when SpaceX manages to optimize the reusability of its Falcon 9 boosters to the extent that almost zero refurbishment or in-depth inspection is needed between launches, minimizing the amount of human effort that goes into something as basic as preparing landing legs may actually have a significant impact on launch costs. For the time being, we get to enjoy the new and unusual spectacle of a giant reusable booster carefully stowing its landing legs for another launch attempt.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

If the problems can be resolved within the next 18 or so hours, SpaceX and NASA will try again with a new T-0 of 2:48 am EDT (06:48 UTC), May 4th.", "This scrub is more than a little ironic given that NASA and ISS astronauts were rushing to repair a space station power bus failure just half a day prior, a power problem that subsequently scrubbed CRS-17 from May 1st to May 3rd. 15 minutes to launch, SpaceX\u2019s launch director announced that drone ship OCISLY was \u201cunable to maintain power\u201d, presumably meaning that the vessel couldn\u2019t properly station-keep with its four thruster pods. Power issues on the space station freshly fixed, CRS-17 has thus been delayed due to power issues on a drone ship.", "During booster recovery, SpaceX\u2019s recovery crew are stationed several miles away from the drone ship for obvious safety reasons. Due to the instantaneous nature of the launch window, there was likely not enough time to transfer technicians onto OCISLY, allow them to repair the issue, and take them back to safety without delaying liftoff. ", "Additionally, the launch director noted that a leak had been detected while loading helium onto Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage, associated with a piece of hardware known as the quick-disconnect panel. Several quick-disconnect links connect both Falcon 9 stages to ground support equipment, including propellant (LOX/RP-1) and pressurant (nitrogen and helium) lines, as well as data relays for launch controllers. Assuming telemetry was able to unequivocally isolate the helium leak to ground systems, the quick-disconnect fault was probably not a showstopper, although scrub-induced downtime means that it can now be fixed before the next launch attempt. ", "With any luck, SpaceX\u2019s recovery crew can solve OCISLY\u2019s power issues without having to take the drone ship back to Port Canaveral. This is probably one of very few cases in recent history where a diesel generator (OCISLY\u2019s power source) may actually be to blame for delaying a rocket launch.

SpaceX is currently testing Raptor SN03 (and possibly SN02) a few hundred miles north in McGregor, Texas, just a few hours\u2019 drive south once the engine is deemed flight-ready. Meanwhile, Starhopper itself needs a considerable amount of new hardware before it can begin Raptor-powered flight testing.", "Purely from a visible perspective, the most important component Starhopper is missing is a way to control its attitude and remain stable while under Raptor power, particularly critical for hovering. Enter the aptly-named attitude control system (ACS), essentially a pod of omnidirectional thrusters. SpaceX already happens to have its own extremely mature ACS proven over nearly two dozen successful Falcon 9 and Heavy booster landings, as well as every Falcon upper stage that has ever flown. SpaceX\u2019s ACS is based on powerful nitrogen gas thrusters, known for their white puffs during Falcon 9 booster recovery and landing operations.", "On May 6th and 7th, SpaceX began to install what looked like Falcon ACS pods on Starhopper. Curiously, of the two pairs of thrusters now installed, half appear to be taken directly off of older mothballed Falcon 9 boosters, while the other two seem to have been acquired from a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket. The latter pods may very well have come from Falcon 9 B1050, the booster that unintentionally landed in the Atlantic Ocean last December. ", "Based on the asymmetric location of the first two pod groups, Starhopper\u2019s ACS will probably use a tripod layout. Additionally, the reason for the thruster pairs \u2013 versus Falcon 9\u2019s single pods \u2013 is likely simple: Starhopper is ", "far", " heavier than a Falcon booster. To get the same level of control authority, SpaceX is thus pairing pods together to double the functional strength of Starhopper\u2019s ACS. ", "This leads smoothly to the installation of two (likely soon to be three) new composite-overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs). Starhopper already has two COPVs installed on the outside of its upper tank dome, now effectively confirmed to be helium containers needed to pressurize the vehicle\u2019s methane and oxygen tanks. Based on the fact that Starhopper\u2019s new ACS pods appear to have come straight from Falcon boosters, it\u2019s safe to say that the 2 (or 3) new COPVs will supply the hopper\u2019s thrusters with gaseous nitrogen. ", "In general, this is just the latest chapter in the book of the oddity that is Starhopper. With helium tank pressurization and nitrogen ACS thrusters taken straight from Falcon 9, a major facet of SpaceX\u2019s Mars architecture is entirely missing from the prototype. Known as autogenous pressurization, BFR was meant to use gasified versions of its onboard liquid oxygen and methane to pressurize its propellant tanks. In a similar vein, BFR was expected to integrated the same propellant into its ACS. Simply put, helium is simply out of the question if SpaceX wants to realize its reusable Mars transport architecture. Mars does have a minute quantity of nitrogen available in its already very thin atmosphere, but extracting hundreds or thousands of kilograms is impractical in the near-term, particularly if the first Starship have to carry all of their extraction equipment from Earth.", "Although Musk has seemingly confirmed that Starship and Super Heavy will use ACS thrusters more akin to the Falcon family\u2019s cold nitrogen gas pods, he did also confirm that autogenous pressurization would be a part of even the earliest iterations of the rocket. The move from carbon fiber to steel tanks likely made a major difference, as carbon composites have extremely limited heat resistance. ", "Without autogenous pressurization and propellant tanks closer to the thickness of orbit-capable Starships, Starhopper is really more of a mobile test stand for Raptor than anything else. The ungainly vehicle also offers SpaceX engineers an opportunity to test Starship/Super Heavy avionics in flight conditions, particularly with respect to controlling a real Raptor engine on the fly.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

As of now, the company has no dedicated satellite factory \u2013 space in Hawthorne, CA is far too constrained.

Further, Iridium missions didn\u2019t get the efficiency benefit that Starlink will by launching east along the Earth\u2019s rotational axis. Despite all that, Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters were still able to land less than 250 km (155 mi) downrange after Iridium launches.

Most of the two-dozen payloads manifested on the mission are admittedly unaffiliated with the US military. However, the rideshare \u2013 known as Space Test Program 2 (STP-2) \u2013 was acquired by the USAF for the branch to closely evaluate and certify SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket for critical military launches. The potential upsides of a successful demonstration and evaluation are numerous for both entities and would likely trigger additional positive offshoots. ", "Beyond the general contractual aspects of STP-2, the mission is significant because it will use the third Falcon Heavy center core and second Block 5 variant to be built and launched by SpaceX. Of the technical issues that complicated and delayed SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy development, most can probably be traced back to the rocket\u2019s center core, practically a clean-slate redesign relative to a \u2018normal\u2019 Falcon 9 booster. ", "Most of that work centered around the extreme mechanical loads the center core would have to survive when pulling or being pulled by Falcon Heavy\u2019s two side boosters. Not only would the center core have to survive at least two times as much stress as a Falcon 9 booster, but that stress would be exerted in ways that Falcon 9 boosters simply weren\u2019t meant to experience, let alone survive. After years of work, SpaceX arrived at a design that dumped almost all of that added complexity squarely on the center core and the center core alone. The side boosters would need to use nosecones instead of interstages and have custom attachment points installed on their octawebs and noses, but they would otherwise be unmodified Falcon 9 boosters. ", "On top of that, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon upper stage and payload fairing would require no major modifications to support Falcon Heavy missions. On the opposite hand, the center core would require ", "extensive ", "rework to safely survive the trials of launch, let alone do so in a fashion compatible with booster recovery and reuse. Per the landing photos above, it\u2019s difficult to tell a Falcon Heavy center core apart from a normal Falcon 9 booster, but the small visible changes are just the tips of several icebergs. Aside from a slight indication that the center core\u2019s aluminum alloy tank walls are significantly thicker (they are), center cores feature a variety of unique mechanisms on their octawebs and interstages. All are involved in the tasks of locking all three boosters together, transferring side booster thrust to the center core, and mechanically separating the side boosters from the center core a few minutes after launch.", "Underneath those mechanistic protuberances are the structural optimizations needed for a center core to survive the ordeal of launch. In short, to solve for those new loads, SpaceX wound up building a new rocket. Designing and building a new rocket \u2013 especially one as complex as Falcon Heavy\u2019s center core \u2013 is immensely challenging, expensive, and time-consuming, particularly for the first few built. Like most complex products, building the first two Falcon Heavy center cores was probably no different. To make things worse, boosters 1 and 2 were based on totally different versions of Falcon 9 (Block 3 vs. Block 5), requiring even more work to further redesign and requalify the modified rocket. ", "This is where the center core assigned to Falcon Heavy Flight 3 and pictured above comes into play. Built just a few months apart from B1055, the first finished Falcon Heavy Block 5 center core, the newest center core \u2013 likely B1057 \u2013 is also the first to be built with the same design and manufacturing processes used on its predecessor. In other words, SpaceX can at long last begin serial production of Falcon Heavy center cores, allowing its engineering, production, test, and launch staff to finally get far more accustomed to the unique hardware.", "Given Falcon Heavy\u2019s healthy and growing manifest of 5-6 launches, SpaceX will probably need to build several additional Block 5 center cores over the next several years, hopefully resulting in a more refined flow for production, testing, and refurbishment. B1057 will be an excellent candidate for the first reused Falcon Heavy center core thanks to STP-2\u2019s lightweight nature and an extremely gentle landing trajectory. With respect to Flight 3\u2019s schedule, Crew Dragon\u2019s April 20th explosion means that Falcon Heavy will have Pad 39A all to itself for many months to come. Truly the epitome of bittersweet, no doubt, but it does improve the odds that Falcon Heavy\u2019s June 22nd STP-2 launch target will hold.

Several questions from members of the press centered around a launch scrub that pushed CRS-17 from May 3-4. SpaceX VP of Flight Reliability Hans Koenigsmann noted that SpaceX is moving to a concept of operations where booster recovery is just as important and just as necessary as any other technical aspect of launch.", "In other words, when SpaceX drone ship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) suffered a rare hardware failure that hobbled its redundant power supplies, NASA had no qualms with the company\u2019s decision to scrub the launch attempt. In fact, confirming educated speculation ", "previously published on Teslarati", ", NASA had a \u201cvested interest\u201d in the successful recovery of B1056.

In fact, of the three (up to as many as five) additional CRS1 Cargo Dragon missions still on contract, there is no immediate technical reason to assume that Falcon 9 B1056 can\u2019t be involved in a majority of those launches, if not all of them. NASA, of course, has the final say in which Falcon 9s their missions launch on, but the agency\u2019s apparent openness to launching on a twice-flown booster opens the door for thrice-flown boosters and beyond.", "B1056\u2019s return also offered a unique \u2013 if not unprecedented \u2013 glimpse of what was likely a purge of TEA/TEB, the pyrophoric fluids Falcon 9 uses to ignite its Merlin engines. Normally, SpaceX recovery technicians likely perform this purge while still hundreds of miles out at sea. Drone ship OCISLY\u2019s perch just a dozen or so miles from Port Canaveral and the Florida coast may have precluded this, leading to a rare bit of controlled in-port fireworks. While the sight of open flame beneath a freshly-recovered rocket triggered some immediate and understandable concern from bystanders, the process appears to have been both routine and controlled by SpaceX.", "On a more minor note, SpaceX also appears to have debuted at least one minor (visible) hardware modification on B1056, utilizing a new hybrid method to join the top of Falcon 9\u2019s liquid oxygen tank to its interstage (the black section). SpaceX prides itself on the practice of continuously improving all aspects of its rockets and spacecraft, so this change is more of a small visualization of that strategy than a major revelation.", "Up next for SpaceX, however, is a launch that may end up being quite the revelation for observers.

This is further stymied by the fact that \u2013 to date \u2013 the ~$1 billion RCM is probably the most valuable payload SpaceX has ever attempted to launch, making it a clear outlier. But, as they say, \u201cdamn the epistemological torpedoes!\u201d", "RCM\u2019s logistical hell and ~6 months of delays began on December 5th, 2018 when Falcon 9 Block 5 booster B1050 \u2013 having just completed its inaugural launch debut \u2013 experienced a hydraulic pump failure. The first of its kind, B1050\u2019s pump failure killed grid fin control authority and forced the booster to abort into the Atlantic Ocean, where it somehow pulled off a landing soft enough to leave the rocket almost entirely intact. Even more surprisingly, B1050 was safely towed back to port, lifted onto dry land, and shipped off to one of SpaceX\u2019s many Florida hangars for inspection. ", "Despite its near-miraculous survival, B1050 was immediately removed from SpaceX\u2019s fleet of flightworthy boosters. Set to become the least flight-proven flight-proven Block 5 booster yet after supporting a low-energy Cargo Dragon mission, SpaceX and CSA/Maxar had apparently reached an agreement to launch RCM on B1050.2. Despite the availability of other boosters at the time, all available cores had completed two launches (B1046, 47, and 48) or were assigned to a second launch in the near-term (B1049). This is the only rational explanation for the delays that followed. ", "B1049 completed its second launch in mid-January 2019 and has since floated around various SpaceX facilities while waiting for its third mission. Had CSA/Maxar been okay with a twice-flown Falcon 9, B1049 could have likely supported RCM\u2019s launch as early as March or April. Instead, the customer \u2013 as was apparently their right \u2013 concluded that being a booster\u2019s third launch would be an unacceptable risk, whereas launching on a once-flown booster was acceptable. The only possible solution to those demands was to manifest RCM on Falcon 9 B1051, assigned to Crew Dragon\u2019s launch debut. ", "Quite possibly the worst booster one could pick for schedule preservation, Crew Dragon\u2019s launch debut slipped \u2013 to the surprise of very few \u2013 from January to February and finally to March 3rd. B1051 launched, landed without issue, and returned to Port Canaveral a few days later, where it was transported to Pad 39A for refurbishment. The relatively gently-used booster required a bit less than 8 weeks of inspection and refurbishment before being packaged and shipped to California near the end of April (see above). By now, B1051 is likely safely inside SpaceX\u2019s SLC-4E integration hangar, preparing for upper stage integration and a routine pre-launch static fire test. ", "In short, an untimely Falcon 9 anomaly and customer preferences conspired to delay the launch of Canada\u2019s Radarsat Constellation Mission by nearly four months, from February 18th to June 11th. With any luck, the mission\u2019s flow will be issue-free and suffer no additional delays. ", "FCC launch communications licenses currently show that SpaceX plans to return Falcon 9 B1051 to the launch site (RTLS) after launch, rather than landing aboard drone ship Just Read The Instructions (JRTI). With a total launch mass likely around 5000 kg (11,000 lb), Falcon 9 should easily be able to manage a RTLS recovery. However, SpaceX\u2019s West Coast LZ-4 use permit prevents the company from landing rockets at the pad during harbor seal pupping season, typically March thru June. The sonic booms and noise generated during Falcon 9\u2019s spectacular landings might end up stressing endangered harbor seals, potentially causing parents to abandon their seal pups in confusion.

In a recoverable configuration, Falcon 9 is capable of placing about  5500-6000 kg into a full GTO.

To adjust position on orbit, maintain intended altitude, and deorbit, Starlink satellites feature Hall thrusters powered by krypton. Designed and built upon the heritage of Dragon, each spacecraft is equipped with a Startracker navigation system that allows SpaceX to point the satellites with precision. Importantly, Starlink satellites are capable of tracking on-orbit debris and autonomously avoiding collisions.

Relative to the rockets it competes with, Falcon 9\u2019s fairing is actually on the smaller side, but SpaceX has still managed to fit an incredible 60 fairly high-performance spacecraft inside it with plenty of room to spare. Additionally, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says that these \u201cflat-panel\u201d Starlink satellites have no real adapter or dispenser, relying instead on their own structure to support the full stack.

Additionally, krypton thrusters are also 15-25% less efficient than xenon thrusters, meaning that krypton generally requires significantly more power to match xenon\u2019s thrust. However, the likeliest explanation for SpaceX\u2019s choice of krypton over less exotic options is simple: firm prices are hard to come by for such rare noble gases, but krypton costs at least 5-10 times less than xenon for a given mass.

", "That work reached a peak on March 8th when the massive Starhopper was transported from build site to launch pad on a brand new transporter that was delivered and assembled barely 48 hours prior. Ahead of the suborbital prototype\u2019s move, work has been ongoing to construct a replacement fairing for the partial-fidelity vehicle, although there is a chance that the new BFR-related stainless steel sections being assembled could be the start of the first orbital Starship prototype.", "Required after improper planning destroyed Starship\u2019s original nosecone (or fairing) when it broke free from its insufficient moorings during high coastal winds, the replacement has sprouted from sheets of metal into a far more substantial structure in barely two weeks. Designed as two integral parts of a suborbital Starship prototype, the upper section (i.e. fairing, nosecone, etc.) is predominately a passive aerodynamic structure with no major active functions, thankfully meaning that the first article\u2019s accidental destruction was a relatively minor loss.", "In fact, it\u2019s entirely possible that the fairing\u2019s demise has had a minimal impact on the commencement of hop tests, and may have even been a net-good for the program given some visible differences between Starship fairings #1 and #2. Despite the fact that the first fairing was destroyed in late January and a comment from CEO Elon Musk indicating that it would trigger a delay of a few weeks, SpaceX did not begin to assemble its replacement until February 21st, a full month later. Over the course of those 30 or so days, the company\u2019s propulsion team simultaneously began hot-fire tests of the first full-scale Raptor engine, ramped thrust and chamber pressure from roughly 40 to 100 percent, and ultimately pushed the engine to the point of damage around the second week of February. ", "Work on the primary structure of the Starship prototype also proceeded apace, fleshing out the brute-force steel vehicle with the beginnings of serious avionics and plumbing and more or less completing the structure of its liquid oxygen and methane propellant tanks. SpaceX workers also rapidly expanded and built-out Starship\u2019s prospective hop test launch pad just a few thousand feet distant, installing tank farms, piping, water deluge hardware, and building an actual concrete \u2018pad\u2019 with umbilical connection ports and attachment points for the ship\u2019s three fin-legs.", "Welding and assembly of the replacement nosecone began around February 21st, rapidly growing from a few sheets of steel to a nearly-complete barrel section measuring about 9m tall and 9m in diameter (30ft x 30ft). Intriguingly, the new fairing appears to be a significant departure from the structural composition of its predecessor, utilizing far thicker sheets of stainless steel joined by uninterrupted width and lengthwise welds. Compared to the first fairing\u2019s dependence on extremely thin (nearly foil-like) steel sheets and a separate internal framework of metal bars, Starship fairing V2 appears to be easily capable of standing under its own weight and then some. While largely passive, it\u2019s likely that once the structure is complete, some level of additional avionics (and perhaps cold or hot-gas maneuvering thrusters) will be installed inside.", "Keeping in the practice of dramatically lowering costs by prioritizing consumer off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware solutions wherever possible, SpaceX has purchased or leased a quartet of (likely used) crawlers for the purpose of transporting Starship between the company\u2019s South Texas build, launch, and landing sites. Built by a European conglomerate known TII Group and owned by US-based Roll Group, SpaceX\u2019s four crawlers \u2013 coupled to form a duo of larger crawlers \u2013 should be more than capable of transporting anywhere from 500t to 1000t or more, easily supporting Starhopper and/or Starships and Super Heavy boosters. ", "Rather than spending huge amounts of money to develop or contract out a custom-designed crawler or transporter solution for BFR, SpaceX appears to have simply purchased off-the-shelf hardware and affixed them with heavy steel structures capable of securing and supporting Starhopper during transport. Within 24 hours of the crawler arrivals, those beams were installed and the transporter had been moved underneath Starhopper and attached to it before quite literally jacking the massive ship off the ground, allowing technicians to weld additional structures to the tips of its three legs.", "Perhaps most curious of all, Starhopper\u2019s replacement fairing was recently joined by the start of work on a separate barrel section that appears to be nearly identical. Assuming the presumed fairing is, in fact, a fairing-to-be, the combined height of the two barrel sections would already make it significantly taller than the original nosecone, and the beginning of the conical taper has yet to appear on either assembly. This could generally mean one of two things. First, the new fairing could make Starhopper much taller than its short-lived predecessor. Second, SpaceX could be planning to begin (or even complete) hop tests without a fairing, in which case the presumed fairing and its slightly younger twin could actually be the beginning of a higher-fidelity Starhopper or even the orbital Starship prototype hinted at by Musk earlier this year.", "While far less likely than the first option, the latter alternative is further supported by the fact that visible work has begun on some sort of tapered or curved steel complements to the new sections in work. While they certainly could be the beginning of the fairing\u2019s tapered cone, the latest segments only loosely resemble the start of a gradual curve. Instead, they look similar to the steel segments of several giant tank domes that were assembled, welded, and installed inside Starhopper last month. ", "On March 8th, SpaceX began the transport of its first full-scale Starship prototype at the same time as CEO Elon Musk indicated that the first flightworthy Raptor(s) would be delivered to South Texas and installed on the hop test article as early as next week (March 11-17). It\u2019s now looking increasingly likely that any replacement fairing that may or may not be under construction might not be ready for installation on Starhopper before SpaceX begins integrated static-fire tests and maybe even low-altitude tethered hop tests.

Whether or not the aggressive mid-May schedule holds, the first launch of operational Starlink satellites would be a huge milestone for SpaceX\u2019s low Earth orbit (LEO) internet constellation, meant to eventually provide high-quality, affordable broadband access to almost anyone on Earth. ", "In November 2018, SpaceX filed a modification to the license it been previously granted by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in March, requesting that it be allowed to dramatically change the first phase of its Starlink satellite constellation.

In fact, ", "according to Reuters", ", Musk challenged the Starlink team to begin launching the constellation\u2019s first operational satellites just one year later (June 2019), an extraordinary aspiration standing a handful of months after the group had launched its first two early satellite prototypes. According to a source ", "the", " spoke with Reuters, Musk reportedly clashed with several managers, preferring an approach that launched simpler, cheaper satellites as quickly as possible instead of methodically iterating through multiple prototypes to arrive at an optimal solution the first time. ", "While both sides presumably have good reasons for their stubborn preferences, Musk may well be in the right at the end of the day, particularly given the sheer level of competition to complete LEO internet constellations and begin serving customers. An overly cautious approach could risk being so late to market that multiple competitors, ranging from relatively established entrants OneWeb and Telesat to more obscure companies like WorldVu and Space Norway. Barely a week ago, OneWeb completed the first successful launch of its constellation, placing six demonstration satellites in orbit to prove their technology and reduce risk prior to commencing operational launches with 30+ satellites apiece. Furthermore, both Tesla and SpaceX have more or less flourished while using the same approach, evidenced by a culture of continuous improvement where both electric cars and rocket engines are constantly upgraded and improved upon. Falcon 9 famously features a bevy of versions or \u201cblocks\u201d, culminating recently in Falcon 9 Block 5\u2019s major reusability and reliability optimizations.", "Whether or not Musk can be more than a little crazy, it\u2019s nearly impossible to coherently deny the fact that his strategy of delivering a minimum viable product as quickly as possible and gradually improving it over time has a polished record of success. Once again, Falcon 9 is the best and most relevant example in the context of Starlink. SpaceX\u2019s now-workhorse rocket began in a form (Falcon 9 V1.0) nearly unrecognizable compared to its most recent edition, featuring far less performance, no reusability, and an older and less capable version of Merlin. Falcon 9 V1.1 was a radical \u2013 almost clean-sheet \u2013 ", "departure", " from the first vehicle and ", "was", " significantly more powerful while also offering structures that could support grid fins and landing legs.

Several additional iterations later, and \u2013 while Block 5 does share a great deal of heritage with its predecessors \u2013 Falcon 9 is also a near-total redesign, replacing or dramatically changing nearly all critical systems aside from the basic structure of its aluminum alloy propellant tanks. ", "In short, when Elon Musk and other SpaceX engineers originally conceived of Falcon 9 in the early 2000s, 2018\u2019s Falcon 9 Block 5 was effectively the rocket they were imagining. Rather than spending countless hundreds of millions of dollars to privately design, test, and redesign multiple prototype iterations, Musk et al built a minimum viable product, began launching payloads for paying customers (both government and commercial), and used the company\u2019s reputation, commercial success, and flight experience to shape Falcon 9 into the industry leader it is today. ", "Put simply, there is no reason to think that the same approach will not prove equally fruitful when applied to satellites instead of rockets. While SpaceX has yet to receive an FCC grant for its Starlink modification request, the company summarized its updated strategy in the November 2018 filing. The request effectively \u201crelocates\u201d the first phase of its 4,425 (now 4209) satellite LEO constellation, moving 1584 satellites from an 1100 km to 550 km orbit and simplifying the design of the first operational spacecraft by using just one spectrum segment (Ku-band) instead of two (Ku- and Ka-band). Hardware to exploit that additional spectrum will be developed and added to Starlink satellites and ground hardware down the road. As such, regardless of how unrefined SpaceX\u2019s first operational Starlink satellites could be, the launch will be just as much of a milestone.

Assuming SpaceX is targeting the 550 km orbit described in its Starlink license modification, this allows the payload mass to be roughly baselined alongside the company\u2019s Iridium NEXT missions, which sent a bit less than 10,000 kg (22,000 lb) of satellite and dispenser to an orbit of ~650 km, a relatively similar orbit ", "and", " mission concept.

Weighing less than 500 kg apiece with a dispenser (per Iridium NEXT) around 10% of the total payload mass, SpaceX will likely launch anywhere from 20-40 Starlink satellites at once, depending on the final mass of these first spacecraft and their custom-built dispenser.

A step further, CEO Elon Musk offered updates on March 17th about progress being made towards a new, metallic heat shield technology meant to make ablative shields like those on Dragon outdated, serving as a striking bit of contrast to SpaceX\u2019s newest spacecraft, potentially just a dozen or two months away from already becoming anachronistic.", "Generally speaking, the basic appearance of Crew Dragon \u2013 compared alongside Cargo Dragon, \u2018Dragon 1\u2019 \u2013 after its first orbital reentry immediately suggests that one or several things about the new capsule and its reentry experience are quite a bit different from the Dragon reentries now familiar.

Situated at the port specifically due to logistical concerns about the high cost of transporting 9m/30ft-diameter objects from SpaceX\u2019s main Hawthorne facilities to a barge for transport east, the company has decided to unequivocally destroy its aerospace-grade composite tooling less than 12 months after accepting delivery. Put simply, this is the best evidence yet that SpaceX \u2013 willing or not \u2013 has gone all-in on build Starship and Super Heavy out of stainless steel less than six months after CEO Elon Musk began to hint at the program\u2019s utterly radical pivot. ", "From the very beginning of SpaceX and Elon Musk\u2019s serious pursuit of an entirely reusable launch vehicle capable of transporting dozens of astronauts and passengers to and from Earth and Mars, the plan had been to build the vast majority of the rocket\u2019s booster and spacecraft structures out of advanced carbon fiber composite materials. Above all else, this fundamental architecture was motivated largely by the significant performance gains a rocket could achieve by replacing traditional aluminum tanks and structures with carbon fiber. ", "For a rocket (and especially an orbital spaceship) meant to somehow make Earth-Mars transport both routine and at least minutely affordable, focusing primarily on the optimization of the mass of cargo delivered relative to the empty weight of the spaceship and booster made (and still does make) a great deal of sense. Assuming that the reusability of a system is roughly constant, the only conceivable way to further lower the cost of price per unit of cargo or passenger ticket would be to increase the usable cargo/passenger capacity for each individual launch, making an extremely light and high-performance rocket the low-hanging fruit target. ", "The centrality of carbon fiber composites remained with SpaceX\u2019s Sept. 2017 iteration of BFR, downsized by 25% to a diameter of 9m (~30 ft). Around six months later, that commitment to composites was further solidified by the delivery of the first 9m-diameter carbon fiber tooling in March or April 2018. The tooling used to mold and ", "lay up", " aerospace-grade advanced carbon fiber structures is inherently expensive, demanding extremely low tolerances across massive surface areas and volumes in order to ensure the quality of the equally massive and low-tolerance composite structures they are used to build. Actual prices are often closely guarded and difficult to determine or extrapolate off of, but it\u2019s safe to say that SpaceX likely spent months of effort and at least several million dollars to acquire its large BFR mandrel.", "In the subsequent months of 2018, SpaceX\u2019s BFR and composite R&D team spent tens of thousands of hours building out an ad-hoc advanced composites workshop inside a temporary tent in an industrial area, and ultimately managed to build a number of full-scale carbon fiber segments, including at least one large tank barrel section and the beginnings of a tank dome. In September 2018, that progress was partially revealed alongside the announcement that Japanese billionaire Yasuka Maezawa had purchased the first crewed lunar launch of BFR for several hundred million dollars, set to occur no earlier than 2023. ", "Two months after indicating that the first BFR \u201cairframe/tank barrel section\u201d would be built out of a \u201cnew carbon fiber material\u201d, Musk provided the very first teaser for a \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d development that would later be identified as the CEO\u2019s decision to wholly replace BFR\u2019s proposed used of composites with stainless steel and an advanced metallic heat shield. Still more than a little controversial and hard to follow almost half a year later, the feeling at the time was that SpaceX\u2019s eccentric leader had decided to throw away more than 24 months of composite BFR design and development work for an almost entirely unproven alternative approach. ", "For better or for worse, it appears that SpaceX (or maybe just Musk) has quite literally trashed the most concrete demonstration of a prior commitment to advanced carbon fiber composites, scrapping the vast majority of its composite tooling and perhaps even the prototype BFR segments built in 2018. ", "It remains to be seen whether the now-permanent decision to pursue a stainless steel design in place of carbon fiber was a very expensive mistake, a stroke of genius, or something in between, However, the undeniably brisk progress made with the BFR\u2019s steel variant in last four or so months bodes well \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 for Musk\u2019s optimism that this radical change will ultimately result in an operational vehicle far sooner (and presumably cheaper) than the composites route. ", "Generally speaking, it seems safe to \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 agree with Musk\u2019s argument that steel should ultimately lend itself far more easily to reusability thanks to its high tolerance for extreme temperatures. Unlike Falcon 9\u2019s aluminum structures (and even the most exotic, advanced carbon fiber composites), certain varieties of stainless steel can weather heating approaching that experienced during orbital reentry with minimal erosion or damage to its mechanical properties. As Musk puts it, the Super Heavy booster\u2019s suborbital trajectory could require almost no heat shielding \u2013 and perhaps even paint \u2013 at all.", "Only time will tell whether the inevitably harsher realities of real-life engineering are so kind.

While it could simply be a matter of convenience and efficiency to start integrated Starhopper testing immediately instead of waiting for the completion of additional Raptor engines, the process of testing a thrust structure or integrated rocket with an increasing number of engines installed is a relatively common practice in aerospace. Regardless of its history, SpaceX itself also began its first integrated testing of a Falcon 9 first stage in the same way, starting with one Merlin engine installed and ultimately graduating to 3, 5, and the final 9 engines over the course of a few months of testing.

While more of a rough testbed than an actual representation of the hardware and structures that will be required for a reusable orbital-class Starship, Starhopper has at least acted as a crash course (either technically or organizationally) on fabricating and assembling stainless steel aerospace structures, a material largely foreign to SpaceX flight hardware prior to late 2018.

Contracted by NASA to companies like Boeing, the outright failure of SLS contractors to stem years of launch delays and billions in cost overruns has lead to what can only be described as a possible tipping point, one that could benefit companies like ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. ", "On March 11th, the White House\u2019s 2020 NASA budget request proposed an aggressive curtail of mission options available for the SLS rocket, preferring instead to save hundreds of millions (and eventually billions) of dollars by prioritizing commercial launch vehicles and indefinitely pausing all upgrade work on SLS. On March 13th, Administrator Bridenstine stated before Congress that he was dead-set on ensuring that NASA sticks to a current 2020 deadline for Orion\u2019s first uncrewed circumlunar voyage (EM-1), even if it required using two commercial rockets (either Falcon Heavy or Delta IV Heavy) to send the spacecraft around the Moon next year. In both cases, it\u2019s safe to say that the political tides have somehow undergone a spectacular 180-degree shift in attitude toward SLS, the first salvo in what is guaranteed to be a major political battle.", "Of the many potential challenges the ides of March have placed before SLS, the first and potentially most significant involves the rocket\u2019s tentative path to future upgrades over the course of its operation. Those upgrades primarily center around the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) and a new mobile launcher (ML) platform, as well as a longer-term vision known as SLS Block 2. At least with respect to the EUS, NASA (and politicians) were apparently less and less okay with the extraordinary amount of money and time Boeing suggested it would need to develop the new upper stage, to the extent that cutting (or \u201cdeferring\u201d) its development could likely save NASA billions of dollars between now and the distant and unstable completion date. Without the EUS, SLS would be dramatically less useful for extreme deep space exploration, effectively the entire purpose of its existence. Instead, the White House included language that would limit SLS launches to crew transfer missions with the Orion spacecraft and nothing more, cutting out heavy cargo missions for science or station-building. Ultimately, those crew transport launches would probably be more than enough to keep SLS Block 1 and Orion busy. ", "However, two days later, Administrator Bridenstine stated before Congress that he was dead-set on ensuring that NASA sticks to a current 2020 deadline for Orion\u2019s first uncrewed circumlunar voyage (EM-1), going so far as to suggest that NASA was examining the possibility of launching the ~26 ton (57,000 lb) spacecraft on a commercial rocket, followed by a separate launch of a boost stage to send Orion to the Moon. If this were to occur, the consequences could be far-reaching for SLS, potentially delaying the first crewed launch of Orion on SLS until EM-3 and creating a ready-made, one-to-one replacement for SLS at drastically lower costs. At that point, nothing short of political heroics and aggressive bribery could save the SLS program from outright cancellation.  ", "As it stands, the only rockets capable of conceivably supporting a 2020 launch of the 26-ton Orion are ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy and SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy, both of which are certified by NASA for (uncrewed) launches. In fact, Falcon 9 was very recently certified by NASA\u2019s Launch Services Program (LSP) to launch the highest priority NASA payloads, signifying the space agency\u2019s growing confidence in SpaceX\u2019s reliability and mission assurance. While the process of certifying Falcon Heavy for an uncrewed Orion launch would be far more complicated than simply grouping Falcon 9\u2019s readiness with Heavy, it would no doubt help that Falcon Heavy is based on hardware (aside from the center core) almost identical to that found on Falcon 9. ", "The fact that Bridenstine indicated that the primary goal of these potential changes was to speed up EM-1 \u2013 an uncrewed demonstrated of Orion functionally similar to Crew Dragon\u2019s recent DM-1 mission \u2013 is also significant, as is the fact that such a commercial SLS stand-in would require two separate launches to complete the mission. One launch would place Orion and its service module (ESM) into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), while a second launch would place a partially or fully-fueled upper stage into orbit to propel Orion on a trajectory that would take it around the Moon and back to Earth, similar to the milestone Apollo 8 mission. The need for two launches and the fact that Orion would be uncrewed means that both SpaceX and ULA would be possible candidates for either or both launches, potentially allowing NASA to exploit a competitive procurement process that could lower costs further still.", "If Europa Clipper is anything to go off of, launching Orion EM-1 on a commercial rocket could save NASA and the US taxpayer at least $700M (before any potential development costs), aided further by potential competition between ULA and SpaceX. On the other hand, a system that can launch Orion and support EM-1 could fundamentally support ", "all", " Orion EM missions, of which many are planned. Whether or not Bridenstine and the White House have considered the ramifications, what that translates into is a direct and pressing threat to the continued existence of SLS, with the White House recommending that the rocket be barred from launching large science missions or space station segments as the NASA administrator proposes making it redundant for Orion launches. As Ars Technica\u2019s Eric Berger rightly notes in the tweet at the top of this article, those are the only three conceivable projects where SLS would have any value at all. ", "If NASA actually went through with this preliminary plan to launch Orion around the Moon on a commercial rocket, they agency would have also fundamentally created a packaged replacement for SLS with a price tag likely 2-5 times cheaper. If Congress had the option to choose between two offerings with similar end-results where one of the two could save the US hundreds of millions of dollars at minimum, it would be almost impossible to argue for the more expensive solution.", "Despite the potential competitive procurement opportunity for a commercial Orion launch, things could get significantly more complicated depending on the political motivations behind the White House and NASA administrator. While Bridenstine explicitly avoided saying as much, the options available to NASA would be ULA\u2019s Boeing-built Delta IV Heavy (DIVH) rocket and SpaceX\u2019s brand new Falcon Heavy. DIVH holds a present-day advantage with active NASA LSP certification for uncrewed spacecraft launches, something Falcon Heavy has yet to achieve.", "Nevertheless, it could be the case that NASA, Bridenstine, and/or the White House have a vested interested in potentially replacing SLS for crewed Orion launches entirely. Either way, it\u2019s incredibly unlikely that NASA would launch SLS for the first time ever with astronauts aboard, a massive risk that would also patently contradict the agency\u2019s posture on Commercial Crew launch safety, which has resulted in one uncrewed demo for both Boeing and SpaceX before either be allowed to launch astronauts. NASA also demanded that SpaceX launch Falcon 9 Block 5 ", "seven times", " in the same configuration meant to launch crew. If NASA is actually interested in at least preserving the option for future crewed launches using the same commercial arrangement, Falcon Heavy is by far the most plausible option Orion\u2019s first uncrewed launch. NASA and SpaceX are deep into the process of human-rating Falcon 9 for imminent Crew Dragon launches with NASA astronauts aboard, meaning that NASA\u2019s human spaceflight certification engineers are about as intimately familiar with Falcon 9 as they possibly can be.", "Given that much of Falcon Heavy has direct heritage to Falcon 9, particularly so for the family\u2019s newest Block 5 variant, SpaceX has a huge leg up over ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy if it ever came time to certify either heavy-lift rocket for crewed launches. In a third-party study commissioned by NASA and completed in 2009, The Aerospace Corporation concluded that Delta IV Heavy ", "could", " be human-rated but would require far-reaching modifications to almost every aspect of the rocket\u2019s hardware and software. Most notably, Aerospace found \u2013 in a truly ironic twist of fate \u2013 that Boeing would likely need to develop a wholly new upper stage for a human-rated Delta IV Heavy, increasing redundancy by increasing the number of RL-10 engines from two to four. As proposed by Boeing, the Exploration Upper Stage \u2013 under threat of deferment due to high cost and slow progress \u2013 would also feature four RL-10 engines and much of the same upgrades Boeing would need to develop for EUS. Aside from an entirely new upper stage, ULA would also need to develop and qualify an entirely new variant of the RS-68A engine that powers each DIVH booster. Ultimately, TAC believed it would take \u201c5.5 to 7 years\u201d and major funding to human-rate Delta IV Heavy.", "Meanwhile, Falcon Heavy already offers multiple-engine-out capabilities, uses the same M1D and MVac engines \u2013 as well as an entire upper stage \u2013 that are on a direct path to be human-rated later this year, and two side boosters with minimal changes from Falcon 9\u2019s nearly human-rated booster. NASA would still need to analyze the center core variant and stage separation mechanisms, as well as Falcon Heavy as an integrated and distinct system, but the odds of needing major hardware changes would be ", "far", " smaller than Delta IV Heavy. ", "Regardless, it will be truly fascinating to see how this wholly unexpected series of events ultimately plays out as Congress and its several SLS stakeholders begin to analyze the options at hand and (most likely) formulate a battle plan to combat the threats now facing the NASA rocket.

For SpaceX\u2019s Starship, it\u2019s likely that the coolant of choice would be either liquid water or liquid methane, the former of which offers better cooling per unit of mass at the cost of added plumbing complexity and spaceship mass, while the latter would make use of the same propellant fueling the ship at the cost of worse cooling per unit of mass. Either way, SpaceX will be heading into unproven territory, demanding extensive ground and flight testing to first ensure that the concept is truly viable and then to verify that it can be made as reliable and reusable as it simply has to be.

Being a predominately smooth cylinder, Falcon 9\u2019s first stage is inherently prone to rotation in the presence of high-velocity air currents, which is why its grid fins are an absolute necessity for maintaining control authority during in-atmosphere \u201cflights\u201d.", "In a show that will turn the stomach of anyone familiar with a rocket\u2019s typically narrow load tolerances, Falcon 9 B1050 experienced\u00a0", "extreme\u00a0", "aerodynamic stresses during the worst of its uncontrolled tumble, to the extent that the entire booster and interstage can be seen\u00a0visibly twisting at least 5 degrees left and right from the perspective of an onboard camera.

In other words, SpaceX\u2019s desire to lower the initial operating orbit of ~1600 Starlink satellites would end up dramatically reducing the consequences the failure of one or several satellites would have on other spacecraft operating in the same orbital regions", "A step further, there is a great deal more irony to be found in ", "OneWeb\u2019s", " attempt to block SpaceX from lowering the orbit of its first ~1600 satellites. In 2017 and 2018, the company repeatedly complained to the FCC about the fact that SpaceX\u2019s Starlink constellation was to nominally be placed in orbits from ~1100-1300 km, effectively sandwiching OneWeb\u2019s own ~1200 km constellation. OneWeb continues to demand an unreasonable level of special treatment from the FCC, hoping that the commission will allow it to establish a sort of buffer zone extending 125 km above and below its own constellation, basically demanding that a huge swath of low Earth orbit be OneWeb\u2019s and OneWeb\u2019s alone. In reality, this is likely nothing more than a thinly veiled anti-competitive tactic, in which success would almost entirely bar other prospective space-based internet providers from even considering the same orbit. ", "SpaceX never explicitly says as much but it becomes eminently clear that the authors behind this latest response are rapidly losing patience with OneWeb\u2019s years of shoddy attempts at legally suppressing competition.

In essence, it appears that OneWeb made the bizarre decision to cite officially-unconfirmed and often-disputed reports that SpaceX\u2019s prototypes were ", "unable", " to reach their originally planned operational orbits of ~1125 km, effectively trapped at the ~515 km orbit they were dropped off in as a result of their shared launch.", "While there was, in fact, some plausible evidence in mid-2018 that at least tentatively suggested that the spacecraft may have had issues with their first-generation ion thruster prototypes, it soon became clear that SpaceX and several major investors were sticking to the narrative that the Tintin twins were operating in fine health in orbit. It\u2019s possible that SpaceX\u2019s legal team and government relations executives are trying to aggressively spin on-orbit difficulties with the prototypes into good news, and the fact that SpaceX is requesting a modification to ", "550 km", " instead of Tintin A and B\u2019s ~520 km orbits remains more than a little odd.

The render also serves as a visual reminder of just how little SpaceX would necessarily need to change or re-certify before Falcon Heavy would be able to launch Orion. Aside from the fact that NASA\u2019s Launch Services Program (LSP) is not quite ready to certify the full launch vehicle for NASA missions, very few hurdles appear to stand in the way of Orion launching on a commercial rocket \u2013 be it on Falcon Heavy or ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy.", "In a wholly unexpected announcement made by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine during a March 13th Congressional hearing, the agency leader revealed that NASA was seriously analyzing the possibility of launching Orion\u2019s uncrewed lunar demonstration mission \u2013 known as Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) \u2013 on commercial launch vehicles instead of the agency\u2019s own Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.", "The purpose: maintain the missions launch schedule \u2013 2020 \u2013 in the face of a relentless barrage of delays facing the SLS rocket, the launch debut of which has effectively been slipped almost three years in the last 18 or so months, with the latest launch date now featuring a ", "median ", "target of ", "November 2021", ".

Admittedly, NASA\u2019s proposed commercial alternative for Orion\u2019s lunar launch debut also offers a range of different but equally concerning risks for the program and mission assurance.", "On one hand, the task of successfully launching NASA\u2019s Orion spacecraft around the Moon with Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy rockets has a lot going for it, regardless of which rockets launch Orion to LEO or launch the fueled upper stage to boost it around the Moon. In 2014, NASA and ULA successfully launched a partial-fidelity Orion spacecraft to an altitude of 3700 miles (~6000 km), testing some of Orion\u2019s avionics, general spacefaring capabilities, and the craft\u2019s heat shield, although Lockheed Martin has since significantly changed the shield\u2019s design and method of production/installation. Regardless, the EFT-1 test flight means that a solution already more or less exists to mate Orion and its service module (ESM) to a commercial rocket and launch the duo into orbit.", "If ULA is unable to essentially produce a Delta IV Heavy from scratch in less than 12-18 months, Falcon Heavy would be next in line to launch Orion/ESM, a use-case that might actually be less absurd than it seems. Thanks to the fact that SpaceX\u2019s payload fairing is actually wider than the large Orion spacecraft (5.2 m (17 ft) vs. 5 m (16.5 ft) in diameter), any major risks of radical aerodynamic problems can be largely retired, although that would still need to be verified with models and/or wind-tunnel testing. The only major change that would need to be certified is ensuring that the Falcon second stage is capable of supporting the Orion/ESM payload, weighing at least ~26 metric tons (~57,000 lb) at launch. The heaviest payloads SpaceX has launched thus far were likely its Iridium NEXT missions, weighing around 9600 kg (21,100 lb). ", "However, the most difficult aspects of Bridenstine\u2019s proposed alternative are centered around the need for the EM-1 Orion spacecraft to somehow dock with a fueled upper stage meant to be launched separately. Orion in its current EM-1 configuration does not currently have the ability to dock with anything on orbit, a challenge that would require Lockheed Martin and subcontractors to find a way to install the proper hardware and computers and develop software that was \u2013 prior to this surprise announcement \u2013 only planned to fly on EM-3 (NET 2024). As such, Lockheed Martin \u2013 notorious for slow progress, cost overruns, and delays throughout the Orion program \u2013  would effectively become the critical path in finishing and installing on-orbit docking capabilities on Orion in less than 12-18 months. ", "The only alternative would be to have either SpaceX or ULA retrofit some sort of docking mechanism onto one of their upper stages, perhaps less difficult than getting Lockheed Martin to work expediently but still a major challenge for such a short developmental timeframe. Put simply, completing the tasks at hand in the time allotted could easily be beyond the capabilities of old-guard NASA contractors like LockMart and Boeing. Ironically, the upper stage that was designed for EM-1 and is already more or less complete \u2013 known as the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS) \u2013 is built by Boeing, the same company that has the most to lose if NASA chooses to make the SLS rocket \u2013 which Boeing also builds \u2013 functionally redundant with a commercial dual-launch alternative.

No visible damage was caused, although there was clearly some cause for extensive discussion and preparation per an unusually large and lengthy huddle of more than 30 employees prior to the beginning of the lift.", "Once on land, B1050 had an unusual sling placed exactly where the Falcon 9 booster\u2019s liquid oxygen (LOx) and kerosene (RP-1) propellant tanks were welded together, apparently a location that is particularly sensitive to off-nominal X-axis stress. To give context, imagine bending a cardboard tube or straw in half instead of trying to push its ends together \u2013 Falcon 9\u2019s structure is quite similar in concept. Built primarily 5mm-thick sheets of lithium-aluminum alloy, Falcon 9\u2019s propellant tanks are extremely thin and light while also being aggressively optimized for vertical (up and down) loading, i.e. the forces experienced while accelerating (and eventually decelerating) through the atmosphere during launch and landing.", "As a result, SpaceX almost always pressurizes the first stage propellant tanks of Falcon 9 with nitrogen whenever boosters are horizontal without physical support at their bendy centers. In the case of B1050, SpaceX almost certainly concluded that using its waterlogged umbilical\u00a0ports to inject nitrogen into its tanks was too much of a risk without knowing the precise condition of the piping and the tanks themselves, opting instead to go with a simple sling to prevent damage from unintended bending. Thankfully, B1050 appears to have made it through its dry land ordeal even better than the time it spent in the Atlantic, suffering no visible damage whatsoever.", "\u00a0", "Somewhere between December 14 and 15, the booster was at long last lifted onto SpaceX\u2019s primary East Coast booster transporter and carefully drove the rocket to one of its 2-3 Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) refurbishment and storage hangars, avoiding detection by all but a few passersby. This could full well be the last we see (and even hear) of poor old Falcon 9 B1050, but there is still a decent chance that SpaceX hopes the entire rocket or major components can be easily salvaged.", "Given the extreme care taken during the booster\u2019s lift onto land and the week it spent having legs and grid fins removed, it can be definitively concluded that an effort will be made to save the entire vehicle (sans interstage).

This first is not quite as desirable, though: sans landing legs and titanium grid fins, the new Block 5 booster will be expended after launch and will make no attempt to land.", "At this point in time, the first official confirmation that Falcon 9 will be flying in an expendable configuration was given in a handful of comments made by Vice President of Launch and Build Reliability Hans Koenigsmann at a Dec. 5 press conference.

There is,\u00a0however, still some ambiguity in Hans\u2019 answer.", "If Falcon 9 will be expended solely as a consequence of mission performance requirements despite the oddly low payload mass (~3800 kg) and comparatively\u00a0low-energy orbit (~20,000 km), the only possible explanation for no attempted recovery would be the need for Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage to perform a lengthy second burn after a long coast in orbit. However, the mission parameters the USAF shopped around for would have placed the GPS III satellite into an elliptical orbit of 1000 km by 20,181 km, an orbit that would unequivocally allow Falcon 9 to attempt a drone ship recovery.", "\u00a0", "The reasoning behind this is simple: SpaceX routinely recovers Falcon 9 boosters after far more energetic launches. For example, Falcon 9\u2019s November 15th launch placed the 5300 kg Es\u2019hail-2 satellite into an orbit of 200 km by 37,700 km, after which Falcon 9 B1047.2 performed its second successful landing on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You. A prevailing second theory for the expendable mission lies in the Air Force\u2019s notoriously stodgy and sometimes irrational revulsion at the slightest hint of risk or change \u2013 to minimize perceived risk, the USAF could have thus demanded that SpaceX expend Falcon 9 regardless of whether it was capable of doing so.", "For GPS III SV01, it appears that only time will tell whether the satellite ends up in an orbit that can properly explain the booster\u2019s premature demise.

Instead, SpaceX may have chosen to build some sort of contamination resistance into the clean-slate design of its Starlink satellites, something that would be impractical to expect of customers who have spacecraft that are either already designed or built. Redesigning \u2013 let alone rebuilding \u2013 complex systems is an extremely costly endeavor. However, wide-reaching changes are far easier to implement when starting from a functionally blank page, exactly where SpaceX is with its first-generation Starlink satellites.

", "Aside from opening the door for new areas of competition in military launch procurement, successfully proving the long-coast capabilities of the Falcon upper stage will also mean that SpaceX can offer them commercially. Military launches often require long coasts in order to get spacecraft to their operating orbits as quickly as possible, typically involving an upper stage burning at the top of a transfer orbit to circularize said orbit. This capability can also be of significant value to non-government customers, however, as the faster a satellite can get to its operational orbit, the faster its owner can start using it to generate revenue. Traditionally, most commercial geostationary communications satellites are sent to transfer orbits, raising one end of the orbit (apogee) but leaving the low end (perigee) in low Earth orbit. Satellites then use their own propulsion systems to circularize their orbits before they can begin commercial operations. ", "It\u2019s safe to assume that SpaceX is interested in commercially offering services like those above to make Falcon Heavy even more competitive with the likes of ULA\u2019s Atlas/Delta/Vulcan rockets and Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 5 and Ariane 6. The US military will almost certainly be the anchor customer, but a reliable upper stage with long-coast capabilities may one day allow Falcon Heavy to routinely launch commercial satellites directly into circular orbits or send flagship NASA spacecraft into deep space. But first, STP-2. According to Taiwan space agency NSPO, involved in the mission through their Formosat-7 constellation (also known as NOAA\u2019s COSMIC-2), Falcon Heavy could launch STP-2 as early as June 22nd.

B1057, believed to be the next new Falcon Heavy center core, is likely already in Florida to prepare for its a launch as early as late June. ", "This leaves either two known flight-proven boosters or new Falcon boosters as the likely suspects captured in a duo of April core spottings, one on April 8th and another on April 17th. SpaceX has two flightworthy Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters \u2013 B1047 and B1048 \u2013 at its Florida facilities, so it\u2019s not out of the question that both spotted cores are new. They could also be B1046 and B1049, both of which recently completed launches from SpaceX\u2019s Vandenberg pad and have been undergoing refurbishment in California. SpaceX\u2019s West Coast manifest could have just two launches for the rest of 2019, meaning that there is no practical reason to keep unassigned boosters nearby.

The launch-hungry venture will need as many Falcon 9 boosters as it can get \u2013 the more, the merrier. Heading into Q3 2019, SpaceX\u2019s first crewed launch of Crew Dragon (DM-2) is in need of a new Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and is reportedly scheduled no earlier than (NET) October. One of the cores spotted in the last week or so could be that very rocket, arriving early due to the gravity of DM-2 and the need to double, triple, and quadruple-check the hardware to best ensure mission success.", "At the end of the day, the most likely explanation is that one of the boosters spotted is new, while one is B1046 or B1049. This is supported by the fact that the second instance was coincidentally tracked throughout its journey, with fans in California, Tuscon, Louisiana, and Florida all catching glimpses between April 12th and April 17th. SpaceX static fires all unflown boosters in McGregor, Texas before they are delivered to a launch site, a procedure that typically takes no less than two weeks from arrival to departure. The booster spotted entering Florida on April 8th, however, does not seem to have been spotted by the same unofficial network of SpaceX fans.

The April 20th event is the first time in the known history of SpaceX\u2019s orbital spacecraft program that a vehicle \u2013 in this case, the first completed and flight-proven Crew Dragon capsule \u2013 has suffered a total failure. Regardless of the accident investigation\u2019s ultimate conclusions, the road ahead of Crew Dragon\u2019s first crewed test flight has become far more arduous.", "According to information acquired by NASASpaceflight.com, SpaceX was in the middle of a series of static fire tests meant to verify that the flight-proven capsule was in good working order after Crew Dragon\u2019s inaugural mission to orbit. The spacecraft was to be tested near SpaceX\u2019s Cape Canaveral Landing Zone facilities, where the company has a small but dedicated space for Dragon tests. Crew Dragon C201\u2019s testing began earlier on Saturday, successfully firing up its smaller Draco maneuvering thrusters. This transitioned into a planned SuperDraco ignition, what would have been the first such integrated test fire for capsule C201.", "SpaceX planned to rapidly reuse Crew Dragon C201 for an upcoming in-flight abort (IFA) test, in which the spacecraft would be required to successfully escape from Falcon 9 at the point of peak aerodynamic stress (Max Q). Based on a leaked video of the failure, one or several faults in Crew Dragon\u2019s design and/or build led to a near-instantaneous explosion that destroyed the spacecraft. Sound in the background seems to indicate that the explosion occurred several seconds before the planned SuperDraco ignition, a major concern given their pressure-fed design.", "As pressure-fed rocket engines specifically designed to be the basis of a launch escape system, Crew Dragon and its SuperDraco thrusters are meant to be ready to ignite at a millisecond\u2019s notice once they are armed in a flight-ready configuration. It\u2019s safe to say that ten seconds away from a specifically planned ignition is one of those moments, although there is a limited chance that SpaceX\u2019s static fire procedures intentionally diverge from an abort-triggered ignition. Regardless, the fact that Crew Dragon was destroyed ", "before", " the ignition of its SuperDracos is not an encouraging sign. ", "Instead of a problem with its high-performance abort thrusters, it can be tentatively concluded that Crew Dragon\u2019s explosion originated in its fuel tanks or propellant plumbing. Such an immediate and energetic explosion points more towards a total failure of propellant lines or valves (or their avionics), while another \u2013 and potentially far more concerning \u2013 cause could be one of Crew Dragon\u2019s pressure vessels. In a space as enclosed as a Dragon capsule, the rupture of a pressure vessel could trigger a chain reaction of pressure vessel failures, freeing both oxidizer (NTO) and fuel (MMH). Known as hypergolic propellant, NTO and MMH ignite immediately (and violently so) when mixed. ", "It\u2019s quite possible that the accident investigation to follow will be SpaceX\u2019s most difficult and trying yet. Regardless of the specific cause, the footage of Crew Dragon C201\u2019s demise does not support any positive conclusions about the fate of astronauts or passengers, had they been aboard during the violent explosion. Seemingly triggered in some way by the very system meant to safely extricate Crew Dragon and its astronauts from a failing Falcon 9 rocket, major work will need to be done to prove to NASA that the spacecraft is safe. Sadly, Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft \u2013 funded in parallel with Crew Dragon under NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program \u2013 suffered a far less severe but no less significant failure during a static fire test of its own abort thrusters. Boeing was forced to remove the impacted hardware from its flight plans to extensively clean, repair, and rework the service module. ", "NASA is now faced with the fact that both of the spacecraft it supported with CCP have exhibited major failures related to their launch escape systems. Crew Dragon\u2019s catastrophic explosion comes as a particularly extreme surprise given how extensively SpaceX has already tested the SuperDraco engines and plumbing, as well as the successful completion of the spacecraft\u2019s launch debut. In the process of DM-1 launch preparations, Crew Dragon likely spent a minimum of 80 minutes with its SuperDraco thrusters and propellant systems primed and ready to abort at any second, apparently without a single mildly-concerning issue.", "Godspeed to SpaceX and NASA as they enter into this challenging and unplanned failure investigation.

", "Longer tests demand that SpaceX begins expanding the known performance envelope of its full-scale Raptor engine. Towards that end, longer-duration tests would need to be done at the company\u2019s McGregor, TX development facilities to reduce risk, tests that Musk confirmed are already well underway. A recent Raptor static fire reportedly lasted no less than 40 seconds, more than enough time for a single-engine Starhopper to significantly expand both the maximum altitude and velocity of future hop tests. In support of the upcoming Starhopper test campaign, significant construction work is also ongoing at SpaceX\u2019s Boca Chica test and development facilities.", "During the months of March and April, SpaceX\u2019s South Texas team effectively completed Starhopper and put the prototype through its first real tests. The process began with tank proof tests in which Starhopper\u2019s tanks were filled with liquid nitrogen \u2013 relatively neutral and unreactive \u2013 to safely identify and repair any leaks, while also subjecting the vehicle to cryogenic temperatures. The proof testing also put the newly installed ground systems (GSE) and vehicle-pad connection hardware through their paces before moving to Starhopper\u2019s nominal liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellant. ", "Following at least half a dozen or so wet dress rehearsals (WDRs) that saw Starhopper loaded with LOx and methane, SpaceX technicians analyzed the health of the prototype and soon began live tests with a Raptor engine installed. Designed to produce no less than 2000 kN (450,000 lbf, 205 mT) of thrust at full throttle, Raptor offers more than twice the max thrust of the latest variant of the Merlin 1D engine that powers Falcon 9 and Heavy (941 kN or 212,000 lbf). In other words, a single Raptor should be more than enough to lift Starhopper off the ground 150+ tons of propellant aboard.", "After several unsuccessful test attempts, Starhopper completed two static fires (<10s combined) and hopped \u2013 tethered \u2013 a handful of feet off the ground on April 3rd and 5th, three weeks after Raptor was first installed. Days later, the lone Raptor engine was removed from Starhopper and shipped back to SpaceX\u2019s Hawthorne, CA factory or McGregor, TX testing facilities for post-test analysis and inspection. In short, SpaceX used Starhopper as a sort of ad hoc test stand for the second serial Raptor (SN02) produced, completing two major acceptance tests simultaneously. ", "A handful of concise tweets published by Musk in the last few days of April implicitly confirmed that the next steps for Starhopper involved untethered flights off its South Texas pad, once again powered by a single Raptor engine. As both the prospective altitudes and flight times rise for future Starhopper tests, so do the risks posed to SpaceX\u2019s adjacent facilities and the prototype itself. To minimize those risks and progress the Raptor program as a whole, SpaceX has been extensively testing the third serial Raptor (SN03) at its McGregor facilities. Instead of a rushed test regime similar to the one that almost completely destroyed Raptor SN01 less than two weeks after testing began, SN03 is participating in a more cautious and systematic series of tests. ", "Confirmed by Elon Musk, this included significantly increasing the length of Raptor SN03\u2019s latest static fires, culminating in an April 27th test that lasted ~40 seconds. Above all else, long test fires are necessary to demonstrate that Raptor can reliably operate for dozens of seconds at a time, given that any failure leading to a loss of thrust could cause Starhopper \u2013 basically a controlled explosive device \u2013 to fall out of the sky. The famous Musk/SpaceX ethos of moving fast and breaking things does not preclude a pragmatic attitude towards the destruction of facilities and prototypes that could take months and millions of dollars to rebuild. ", "The ETA of future hop tests is unclear. For the time being, it appears that SpaceX\u2019s South Texas facilities will be caught up in construction work for at least another week. Whether or not Raptor SN03 is next in line for installation on Starhopper, SpaceX will likely put it through several more long-duration static fires before moving ahead with untethered hop tests. All things considered, the rough Starship prototype is unlikely to restart powered testing for another two or so weeks.

Said constellation has long been the subject of endless skepticism and criticism, dominated by a general atmosphere of dismissal. There is no doubt that Starlink, as proposed, is an extraordinarily ambitious program that will cost billions of dollars to even begin to realize. SpaceX will have to find ways to affordably manufacture and launch ~11,900 satellites \u2013 together weighing something like 500 metric tons (1.1 million lbs) \u2013 in as few as nine years, start to finish.", "As of November 2018, there are roughly 2000 satellites operating in Earth orbit, meaning that SpaceX\u2019s full Starlink constellation would increase the number of functional satellites in orbit by a factor of almost seven. Just the first phase of Starlink (4409 satellites) would more than triple the number of working satellites in orbit. To meet the contractual requirement that SpaceX launch at least half of Starlink\u2019s licensed satellites within six years of the FCC granting the constellation license, the company will need to launch an average of ~37 satellites per month between now and April 2024. By April 2027, SpaceX will either have to launch all ~2200 remaining Phase 1 satellites or risk forfeiture of its Starlink constellation license.

The second main difference between relates to \u201cdemisability\u201d, referring to characteristics exhibited during reentry. The first 75 spacecraft will be less refined and thus feature a handful of components that are expected to survive the rigors of reentering Earth\u2019s atmosphere, creating a truly miniscule risk of property damage and/or human injuries. Subsequent Starlink vehicles will incorporate design changes to ensure that 100% of each satellite is incinerated during reentry, thus posing a ~0% risk on the ground.", "In a sense, the first 75 Starlink satellites will be an in-depth demonstration of SpaceX\u2019s proposed constellation. Depending on how the satellites are deployed in orbit, SpaceX\u2019s development team could potentially have uninterrupted access to the orbiting mini-constellation. There will also be constant opportunities to thoroughly test SpaceX\u2019s network architecture for real, including general downlink/uplink traffic, surge management, satellite handoffs, and the laser interlinks meant to join all Starlink satellites into one giant mesh network.", "SpaceX has yet to announce the precise number of Starlink satellites that will be aboard Falcon 9 on the rocket\u2019s first dedicated internal launch. More likely than not, the constraining factor will be the usable volume of SpaceX\u2019s payload fairing, measuring 5.2m (17 ft) in diameter. For Flight 1, 10-20 satellites is a reasonable estimate. Likely to weigh around 10,000 kg (22,000 lb) total, the first Starlink payload will be delivered to a parking orbit of ~350 km (220 mi), easily allowing Falcon 9 to return to SpaceX\u2019s Florida Landing Zone or perform a gentle landing aboard drone ship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY).

SpaceX thus has two potential buffer missions \u2013 CRS-21 and CRS-22 \u2013 that could theoretically account for up to a year of Dragon 2 delays. Beyond that, additional Dragon 2 delays could create a gap where NASA would have to supply the ISS without SpaceX\u2019s services.

In reality, it\u2019s likely that the failure will delay future Crew Dragon (and thus Dragon 2) launches by a minimum of 6-12 months. SpaceX will likely need to change up the launch order of its capsules, reassigning DM-2\u2019s Crew Dragon to the in-flight abort (IFA) test and the US Crew Vehicle 1 (USCV-1) Crew Dragon to SpaceX\u2019s first crewed demonstration mission (DM-2). After such a serious and potentially fatal failure, it\u2019s even possible that NASA will require an additional uncrewed orbital launch before permitting SpaceX to fly astronauts on Crew Dragon.

With any luck, SpaceX and NASA will be able to solve the technical, organizational, and logistical problems now facing them and ensure a stable future for Dragon 2.

Approximately nine months later, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine announced that all work on future SLS upgrades \u2013 including the Block 1B and Block 2 variants that could have supported the launch of LUVOIR-A \u2013 was to be halted as soon as possible. All of that funding would instead be focused on mitigating a never-ending string of delays and pushing SLS to actually prepare for its first launches. Bridenstine has since publicly waffled on that aggressive plan, simultaneously indicating that some of those SLS upgrades (mainly an advanced upper stage, EUS) would be critical for one variant of his proposal to return astronauts to the Moon as early as 2024.", "Regardless, the blood of SLS is currently in the water as NASA pursues an answer to the question of whether commercial rockets can instead be used to launch the agency\u2019s Orion spacecraft and Lunar Gateway segments.

As a result, there will be almost no conceivable way for the rocket to rise to the 2020 launch debut challenge issued by Bridenstine, potentially meaning that NASA will put significant resources into studying and developing alternatives to SLS.

The changes that are visible, however, confirm that its Boca Chica engineers are working around the clock to complete the first orbital Starship prototype.

New work around the ad-hoc Starhopper pad has recently begun, while construction of a second concrete jig for concurrent prototype fabrication and what will likely be a more permanent hangar and control facility are also ramping up. Things have been quiet news-wise for SpaceX\u2019s McGregor and Hawthorne facilities but there is reason to believe that Raptor production and testing is going smoothly. ", "The most obvious visible progress made in April is centers around SpaceX\u2019s first orbital Starship prototype, soon to begin its third month of active construction. As of mid-March, the shells of two large steel barrel sections \u2013 together about 18 m (60 ft) tall \u2013 were fully erected at the build site, with a handful of other sections in various states of welding. The height of those two cylinders has remained unchanged since then but it\u2019s safe to assume that a ton of work has been going on inside them, invisible to anyone viewing from public perspectives since drones were effectively banned in March. In other words, the two pieces \u2013 most likely the barrel sections of Starship\u2019s liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX) tanks \u2013 are likely being carefully transformed into actual propellant tanks. ", "There is also a good reason for their height differential: the larger (LOX) section is almost exactly a third larger than the small section (methane) in part because of the physical reality that Starship will need almost exactly 33% more LOX than methane by volume. Large propellant tanks \u2013 particularly those meant for cryogenic fluids and spaceflight applications \u2013 are often quite complex, with the vast majority of that complexity happening under the hood. The above render was made while SpaceX was still planning on carbon fiber tanks and also appears to be significantly simplified, but it still offers a small look at some of that complexity.", "Aside from successfully completing thousands of welds throughout the assembly, a lot of the effort of building an advanced tank is put into plumbing \u2013 both internal and external \u2013 needed to load, unload, pressurize, depressurize, and generally manage cryogenic (i.e. super cold) liquid propellant. SpaceX decided to utilize a partial balloon tank design to keep the steel skins of its stainless steel Starship and Super Heavy as thin as possible, adding yet another level of internal work due to the need for stringers and longerons on top of baffles and hardware to mount COPVs or header tanks.", "Adding further complexity to the internal structure of Starship is the presence of major aerodynamic surfaces and landing legs, both of which will need to survive extreme stresses if they are to function as intended. Those structures must be aerodynamically streamlined and attach to the outside of Starship\u2019s hull, likely requiring significant structural reinforcements both inside the spacecraft\u2019s nose and rearmost propellant tank. ", "SpaceX began construction of a second concrete fabrication jig just a handful of days ago. Effectively a copy of a jig occupied with the larger of the two barrel sections of the orbital Starship prototype, the simple structure acts as a mount and includes a large door that allows scissor lifts to get inside the steel structure. The new jig is being built directly adjacent to Starship\u2019s smaller barrel section, suggesting that it could simply be a way to concurrently work on both the LOX and methane tanks. Given the inherent simplicity of a concrete jig, it could also end up being used to support the simultaneous assembly and integration of the first Super Heavy booster prototype. ", "Back in December 2018, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated that the first Super Heavy prototype would start production in \u201cspring\u201d (i.e. NET April 2019). Musk has also indicated that Starship and Super Heavy will be simultaneously built both in Boca Chica, Texas and Cape Canaveral, Florida. In general, SpaceX is clearly beginning another round of expansion and improvement for its Boca Chica facilities, including the new concrete jig and an entirely new building on the same plot of land.

After completing an inaugural round of  multiple wet dress rehearsals (WDRs) and two Raptor static fires/hops, SpaceX technicians removed the vehicle\u2019s lone Raptor engine on April 8th. Starhopper has remained more or less inactive in the last two weeks, aside from some work going on inside the vehicle (per the open access hatch).

Instead, some minor work has been going on around the Hopper\u2019s ad hoc pad, mainly taking the appearance of dirtmoving. Without aerial views, its hard to tell what exactly is taking shape, but it\u2019s safe to say that Starhopper is simply waiting for additional Raptors to be produced, tested, and delivered to Boca Chica.

Short of flying on a new Falcon 9 booster, B1051 does theoretically seem to offer the least risk of failure insofar as one can claim that boosters that have completed more launches are more likely to fail.

Both positions make sense in theory but theory falls flat in the face of actual data, of which only SpaceX and certain customers have access to.", "As an external observer, the best data available is a binary public record of Falcon 9 launch success, as well as the degree to which missions are delayed beyond their scheduled launch targets. Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters have launched 16 times in 11 months, six of which used a flight-proven first stage. Flight-proven boosters appear to be a bit more finicky than unflown rockets in terms of late-stage launch delays, but the data is inconsistent and the sample size statistically insignificant. More generally, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have launched 72 times in nine years and suffered two total failures, both caused by unflown upper stages. In 72 launches, including 20 missions with flight-proven boosters, a Falcon 9/Heavy first stage has never caused a total mission failure.

In general, Falcon 9 \u2013 reused or not \u2013 has consecutively completed 41 successful launches since its second and last mission failure in September 2016, half (49%) of which used flight-proven boosters.

For M1D and MVac, acceptance testing usually takes the shape of a full-duration burn with throttle and gimbal activity to closely simulate a true Falcon 9 or Heavy launch.

Those tests could also begin next month, although a debut sometime in March or April is increasingly likely.", "Effectively designed on a blank slate, Raptor began full-scale component-level tests in 2014 at NASA\u2019s Mississippi-based Stennis Space Center, evolving from main injector development to oxygen preburner hot-fires in 2015.

M1D, powered by refined kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen, uses a combustion cycle (gas-generator) that is relatively simple and reliable at the cost of engine efficiency, although SpaceX propulsion expertise still managed to give M1D the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any liquid rocket engine ever flown. Still, measured by ISP (instantaneous specific impulse), M1D\u2019s inefficient kerolox\u00a0gas-generator cycle ultimately means that the engine simply can\u2019t compete with the performance of engines with more efficient propellants and combustion cycles.", "While SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Heavy rockets \u2013 powered by Merlin 1D and Merlin Vacuum \u2013 are more than adequate in and around Earth orbit, a far more efficient engine was needed for the company to enable the sort of interplanetary colonization Musk had in mind when he created SpaceX. Raptor was the answer. Ultimately settling on liquid methane and oxygen (methalox) as the propellant and a full-flow staged-combustion (FFSC) cycle, Raptor was designed to be extraordinarily reliable and efficient in order to safely power a spacecraft (BFS/Starship) meant to ferry dozens or hundreds of people to and from Mars.", "An excellent NASASpaceflight article explores the engine\u2019s journey from a blank sheet to integrated static-fire tests and offers a deeper explanation of the technical details.", "For all the extensive and invaluable testing SpaceX has done with a series of prototype Raptor engines, the engines tested were subscale versions with around 30% the thrust of the c. 2016 Raptor and around 40-50% of the updated c. 2017 iteration, producing almost the same amount of thrust as Merlin 1D (914 kN to Raptor\u2019s ~1000 kN).

Raptor also featured a mass of spaghetti-like plumbing (complexity necessary for its advanced combustion cycle), with a significant fraction of the metallic pipes and tubes displaying mirror-like finishes. Most notable was an obvious secondary preburner/turbopump stack and the lack of any exhaust port, whereas M1D relies on a single turbopump and exhausts the gases used to power it. Raptor\u2019s full-flow staged-combustion cycle uses separate oxygen and methane preburners\u00a0to power separate turbopumps, significantly improving mass flow rate and smoothing out combustion mixing.", "\u00a0", "Unlike all previous hot-fired Raptors, those shipping now to McGregor, Texas are expected to be the first completed engines with a finalized design, arrived at only after a period of extensive testing and iterative improvement.

At nearly the same time as Falcon Heavy was lifting off for the first time, SpaceX\u2019s world-class production crew was in the midst of manufacturing the first upgraded Falcon 9 Block 5 booster (B1046) and wrapped up final checkouts just 10 days after Heavy\u2019s Feb. 6 launch debut, sending the pathfinder rocket to McGregor, Texas for the first static fire of a Block 5 booster.", "In the meantime, SpaceX\u2019s decision to\u00a0", "intentionally expend\u00a0", "otherwise recoverable reused Falcon boosters after their second launches meant that the company\u2019s fleet of flightworthy rockets was rapidly approaching zero, a move CEO Elon Musk specifically indicated was meant to make room for Block 5, the future (and final form) of the Falcon family. SpaceX\u2019s busy 2018 launch manifest and multiple critical missions for the US government were thus balanced on the success, reliability, and rapid production of a serious number of Merlin engines, boosters, and upper stages. This included B1051 \u2013 the first explicitly crew-rated Falcon 9 \u2013 and B1054, the first SpaceX rocket rated to launch high-value US military (specifically Air Force) satellites.

In hindsight, barring an assumption of a truly miraculous and unprecedented Falcon booster production rate, Falcon Heavy\u2019s next launches were almost guaranteed to occur no fewer than 6-12 months after the rocket\u2019s launch debut \u2013 SpaceX\u2019s entire launch business depended on building 5+ unrelated Falcon 9 boosters, while Falcon Heavy customers Arabsat and the USAF were unlikely to be swayed to launch on flight-proven hardware so early into Block 5\u2019s career.", "Once Falcon 9 B1054 departed SpaceX\u2019s Hawthorne factory (see above) in early October, it appears that the company\u2019s production team pivoted directly to integrating and shipping the next three (or more) Falcon Heavy boosters back to back for the rocket\u2019s second and third launches. The first new side booster departed the factory in mid-November, followed by a second side booster in early December and a (presumed but highly likely) center core at the turn of 2019.

SpaceX\u2019s FCC filings indicate that the center core may travel nearly 1000 km (600 mi) East of Pad 39A to land on drone ship OCISLY after launch, smashing the previous record attempt \u2013 during the June 2016 launch of Eutelsat 117WB \u2013 of ~700 km (430 mi).

Currently stationed at SpaceX\u2019s McGregor, Texas development and testing facilities, Raptor appears to feature an expansion ratio somewhere in between Merlin 1D (optimized for sea-level) and MVac (optimized for vacuum).", "This increases the stress on the nozzle during ignition and operation at normal atmospheric pressures but it also improves engine efficiency once Starship (or Super Heavy) rises above the thickest parts of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, even if a medium-expansion nozzle still can\u2019t touch the performance of a giant vacuum-optimized bell like those used by MVac. As such, BFR in its earliest iterations will be significantly less capable than a fully-optimized version of the rocket when it comes to high-energy Earth/lunar orbits and interplanetary trajectories, a challenge that can at least initially be hurdled by accepting much lower nominal payload capabilities and relying on brute-force performance, much like Falcon 9 and Heavy.", "Assuming the first hot-fire tests of the\u00a0full-scale, operationalized Raptors go well, three of the next-gen engines could support the first hop tests of a full-scale Starship prototype sometime in the next few months, potentially as early as late-February or March.

Being as it is the first time SpaceX has ever attempted a launch directly related to human spaceflight, as well as the first time NASA has been back at the helm (more or less) of US astronaut launch endeavors in more than 7.5 years, significant delays should come as no surprise regardless of how disappointing they may be.", "The most consequential aspect of DM-1\u2019s two-month (at least) delay will likely be the myriad ways it feeds into delays of SpaceX\u2019s in-flight abort (IFA) test and first crewed launch (DM-2), and thus\u2019s NASA\u2019s ability to once again independently launch US astronauts.

While achieving expected thrust is a foundational step forward for the first full-scale Raptor, the engine\u2019s aircraft-like reusability and reliability are ultimately far more important for Starship and Super Heavy.

However, SpaceX\u2019s publicly-available launch manifest suggests that there will be no more than 18 government and commercial missions ready for the company to place in orbit before 2019 is out, implying that Hofeller may be hinting at launches that are not yet public.", "In just the last two years (24 months), SpaceX has successfully launched Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy an astounding 40 times, averaging approximately one launch every 2.5 weeks. In 2017, SpaceX demolished its own prior cadence record with 18 launches, a record the company\u2019s exceptional workforce summarily proceeded to beat in 2018 with 21 successful missions launched. A vast majority of those 40 missions (27 to be precise) were the result of competitive, commercial contracts that SpaceX has been extremely successful at winning, thanks largely to the nearly unbeatable pricing of Falcon 9 and Heavy.", "Much like most other launch providers, SpaceX plays its manifest extremely close to the chest, rarely revealing more than a blanket status update. For example, SpaceX\u2019s website states that it has \u201chas secured over 100 missions to its manifest, representing over $12 billion on contract.\u201d Thanks to the general drought of official manifest information, the closest approximation to a real SpaceX manifest has traditionally been maintained by members of spaceflight fan communities like /r/SpaceX and NASASpaceflight.com, using the best aspects of organized crowdsourcing to create an extremely reliable snapshot of launch contracts scheduled within ~24 months.", "However, compared to SpaceX\u2019s claimed manifest of 100+ missions at an average cost per launch of ~$120M (twice Falcon 9\u2019s $62M list price), crowdsourced SpaceX manifests \u2013 based on mostly public information \u2013 show fewer than 60 possible launch\u00a0contracts between now and the end of 2024, a majority of which are for the US government (Crew and Cargo Dragon, Air Force GPS launches, and a few NASA spacecraft). Given SpaceX\u2019s confident use of \u201csecured\u201d and \u201con contract\u201d, the massive gap between public manifests and SpaceX\u2019s claims leaves more than 40 launches almost completely in the dark.", "Hofeller\u2019s Feb. 6th comment is thus just a tiny taste of SpaceX\u2019s potential mystery manifest, indicating that the company has more than 21 payloads to launch in 2019 while public info reveals no more than 17-18 likely to be ready. Where, then, might Hofeller find an extra 4-5 missions that public observers would not normally be aware of?", "The simplest answer least reminiscent of a conspiracy theory is Starlink, SpaceX\u2019s global constellation of at least 4425 satellites. While it would be an extraordinary achievement,\u00a0", "Reuters reported in October 2018", " that CEO Elon Musk had gone as far as firing multiple senior managers of the young satellite program to install new managers with a singleminded goal: begin launching operational Starlink satellites by mid-2019.

As such, it\u2019s not out of the question for operational Starlink launches to begin as early as mid-2019, although Musk\u2019s aggressive schedule is likely more than a little overly optimistic.", "Assuming Starlink is greeted with a perfect production ramp and the first 10-20 spacecraft make it to orbit in good health by June 2019, it\u2019s at least not inconceivable that a second and third launch could follow, perhaps with a 3-month launch cadence (June/September/December). The chances of this happening are probably about as slim as they come, but it does offer one possible way for SpaceX\u2019s apparent ~18-launch manifest to jump up to 21 or more missions.

Nevertheless, 250 bar is apparently more than enough to operate Starship and its Super Heavy booster during most regimes of flight, although maximum thrust (and thus max chamber pressures) is probably desirable for the first minute or so after launch when gravity losses are most significant.", "\u00a0", "Ultimately, the sheer speed of SpaceX\u2019s full-scale Raptor test program is easily the most impressive and encouraging aspect of the brand new engine design. While SpaceX does tend towards testing to destruction over putting on kid-gloves around flight or development hardware, it\u2019s safe to say that even SpaceX would avoid frivolously destroying the first full-scale Raptor after just a few dozen seconds of integrated hot-fire testing, indicating that no\u00a0major red flags have cropped up since the company\u2019s propulsion team began testing on February 3rd. In fact, Musk estimated that six separate static-fires have been performed with Raptor in the seven days since its first ignition.", "As of 2017, Raptor\u2019s McGregor, Texas test cell was fundamentally capped at test durations under 100 seconds, making comparisons difficult. Still, the best possible recent point of comparison to Raptor\u2019s test program can be found in NASA\u2019s series of tests of Space Shuttle engines in preparation for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, an expendable launch vehicle being built by Boeing, Aerojet-Rocketdyne, NGIS (formerly Orbital-ATK), and others with NASA funds. Known as RS-25 under the SLS Program, the Space Shuttle engines being test-fired by NASA have already performed multiple full-duration missions to orbit and back on the four Space Shuttle orbiters built. After half a decade in storage, they are being re-tested (effectively acceptance testing) to ensure that they are ready to be expended on SLS launches.", "In the first round of 2015 tests, NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center test stage supported six RS-25 static-fires total, ranging from two weeks to almost five months between tests. RS-25 testing has remained on a similar schedule in 2016-2018, averaging 4-6 tests annually with no fewer than two weeks between static-fires. Given that the vast majority of those ex-Space Shuttle Main Engine tests tend to last hundreds of seconds, it\u2019s not a perfect comparison, but it offers at least a general idea of just how incredible it is to see a groundbreaking engine like Raptor test-fired almost daily just days after it was installed on a test stand for the first time.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes!"]},

Despite the fact that Ariane 6 is at least a full year away from its first launch,\u00a0", "Cour des comptes\u00a0", "is already questioning the rocket\u2019s ability to successfully make headway into an increasingly competitive market, competition that has already had a direct and tangible impact on Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 5 launch vehicle.", "While other competitors certainly do exist, the fact remains that that said increase in launch market competition can be almost singlehandedly attributed to the rapid entrance of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket onto the commercial launch scene. Despite major stumbles in 2015 and 2016 as a result of Falcon 9\u2019s CRS-7 and Amos-6 failures, SpaceX appears to have dealt with the organizational faults that allowed them to occur, culminating in an auspicious launch cadence over the course of 2017 and 2018. While Falcon 9 has technically been flying since mid-2010, a full 38 of the rocket\u2019s 64 successful launches were completed in the last 24 months, meaning that more than 50% of Falcon 9\u2019s launches have occurred in the last ~12% of the rocket\u2019s operational life.", "Critically, a number of European nations settled on Ariane 6 as the successor to Ariane 5 in 2014, at which point Falcon 9 had launched just 13 times (7 times commercially) and SpaceX was more than 12 months away from its first successful rocket recovery and ~30 months from its first commercial reuse. To the credit of Arianespace and the EU nations that supported the prospective Ariane 5 successor, Ariane 6 may have actually been able to reliably compete with Falcon 9\u2019s pricing if it had begun launching within 12-24 months of the 2014 decision to build it and if SpaceX had simply sat on its laurels and ended development programs.", "Of course, neither of those prerequisites to Ariane 6\u2019s success occurred. SpaceX successfully reused the same Falcon 9 booster three times in just six months by the end of 2018, while Falcon Heavy is set to attempt its first two operational launches just a few months from now. Ariane 6 is still targeting a launch debut no earlier than (NET) 2020, while a handful of extremely limited reusable rocket R&D programs continue to limp towards nebulous targets with minimal funding. Meanwhile, thanks to Arianespace\u2019s French heritage and the major financial support of French space agency CNES,\u00a0", "Cour des comptes\u00a0", "is in the right to be highly critical of a ~$3.9B rocket development program likely to cost France at least $600M before the first launch.", "\u00a0", "Once Ariane 6 is ready to launch, it\u2019s aspirational pricing will all but guarantee an inability to compete on an even global playing field. Divided into two versions, A62 and A64, Ariane 6 will cost at least 75 million Euros (~$85M) for performance equivalent to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 in its reusable configuration (base price: $62M), while the heavier A64 variant \u2013 capable of placing two heavy satellites (11,500 kg) into geostationary transfer orbit \u2013 will cost at least 90 million Euros (~$102M) per launch. Admittedly, $102M to launch a duo of large geostationary satellites would be easily competitive with Falcon 9 with per-customer costs around $50M, but this only holds true if the imminent commercial introduction of Falcon Heavy (list price: $90M) is ignored.", "However, the market for large geostationary satellites has plummeted into the ground in the last two years, over the course of which just 12 have been ordered. Arianespace thus faces a conundrum where its cheaper Ariane 62 rocket is already too expensive to compete commercially and the potentially competitive Ariane 64 variant is only competitive for a commercial launch market that has withered to barely a third of its nominal demand in just two years time. Acknowledged by France\u2019s auditors (and noted by Mr. Berger), the most probable outcome for Ariane 6 is one in which the very existence of the rocket will be predicated upon continual annual subsidies from the European Space Agency (ESA) in order to make up for the rocket\u2019s inability to sustain commercial orders beyond a handful of discounted shoo-in contracts.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes!"]},

At the end of the day, significant delays to Musk\u2019s truly wild timeline are very likely, but it seems entirely possible at this point that Starhopper really could begin its first hop tests in the first half of 2019, kicking off a test program currently aiming for flights as high as 5 km (3.1 mi) and as long as 6 minutes.", "A whole range of things will have to go perfectly right for a timeline as ambitious as this to be realized, including but not limited to successfully acceptance-testing three brand new and recently-redesigned Raptor engines, the completion of Starhopper\u2019s unfamiliar structures, propellant tankage, plumbing, and avionics, and the completion of a rough launch and landing pad and integration facilities, if needed. Aside from those big ticket items, many dozens of other smaller but no less critical tasks will have to be completed with minimal to no unforeseen hurdles if hop tests are to begin just a few months from now.", "Regardless, SpaceX has pulled off miraculous tasks much like this in its past, and the possibility that the company\u2019s brilliant, dedicated, and admittedly overworked employees will do so again should not be discounted.", "For prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique\u00a0glimpses\u00a0of SpaceX\u2019s rocket recovery fleet check out our brand new\u00a0", "LaunchPad and LandingZone newsletters", "!"]},

These autonomous demo missions will be immediately followed by crewed demonstration missions in which real NASA astronauts will fly to the International Space Station before NASA can finally complete the operational certification of Crew Dragon and Starliner.", "Simultaneous ironic and gratingly painful, the first operational crewed launches are explicitly dependent on certifications to\u00a0immediately follow crewed demonstration launches, which themselves are no less dependent upon the receipt of NASA certifications after each spacecraft\u2019s first uncrewed demonstration launch. As such, every delay to CCPs uncrewed demo launches will likely translate into a near 1:1 delay (if not worse) for the operational debut of both spacecraft, already operating dangerously close to the edge of assured access to the ISS thanks to a range of delays caused by technical challenges and NASA sluggishness.", "NASA currently relies\u00a0entirely on launch contracts on Russian space agency Roscosmos\u2019 Soyuz rocket and spacecraft to deliver NASA astronauts to the ISS, and those contracts are set to end in a fairly permanent manner as early as November 2019, although the end of NASA\u2019s Soyuz access could potentially be pushed back as far as Q1 2020.

If successfully launched, Formosat-7 will dramatically expand Taiwan\u2019s domestic Earth observation and weather forecasting capabilities, important for a nation at high risk of typhoons and flooding rains.", "Although Taiwan officials were unable to offer a target more specific than Q2 2019 (April to June), it\u2019s understood by way of NASA comments and sources inside SpaceX that STP-2\u2019s tentative launch target currently stands in April. For a number of reasons, chances are high that that ambitious launch target will slip into May or June. Notably, the simple fact that Falcon Heavy\u2019s next two launches (Arabsat 6A and STP-2) are scheduled within just a few months of each other almost singlehandedly wipes out any possibility that both Heavy launches will feature all-new side and center boosters, strongly implying that whichever mission flies second will be launching on three flight-proven boosters.", "To further ramp up the difficulty (and improbability), those three flight-proven Block 5 boosters would have to launch as an integrated Falcon Heavy, safely land (two by landing zone, one by drone ship), be transported to SpaceX facilities, and finally be refurbished and reintegrated for their second launch in no more than 30 to 120 days from start to finish. SpaceX\u2019s record for Falcon 9 booster turnaround (the time between two launches) currently stands at 72 days for Block 4 hardware and 74 days for Block 5, meaning that the company could effectively need to simultaneously break its booster turnaround record three times\u00a0 in order to preserve a number of possible launch dates for both missions.", "If it turns out the USAF is actually unwilling to fly its first Falcon Heavy mission on all flight-proven boosters (a strong possibility) or that that has never been the plan, STP-2\u2019s claimed Q2 2019 target would likely have to slip several months into 2019. This would afford SpaceX more time and resources to build an extra three new Falcon Heavy boosters (two sides, one center), each of which requires a bare minimum of several weeks of dedicated production time and months of lead time (at least for the center core), all while preventing or significantly slowing the completed production of other new Falcon boosters.", "The exact state of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Heavy production is currently unknown, with indications that the company might be building or have already finished core number B1055 or higher, but it\u2019s safe to say that there is not exactly a lot of slack in the production lines in the first half of 2019.

If that is not the case, the only possible explanation is that Starhopper\u2019s propellant tanks will actually be less than 9m in diameter and will be lifted up through the vehicle\u2019s aft for installation.", "One last increasingly improbable possibility is that a significant portion of the hopper\u2019s upper half will be or already is a pressure vessel capable of holding cryogenic propellant, although the process of actually watching the less than surgical fabrication does not inspire a great deal of confidence in any potential pressure vessel aspirations.

First and foremost, SpaceX likely needs to do its best to accommodate the preferences of customers CSA and MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.) regardless of how disruptive they may be. Originally targeted for sometime in November 2018, RCM\u2019s launch slipped several months to the second half of February 2019 due to what CSA described as \u201chigher priority missions [for]the US Government and a backlog of launches from\u2026Vandenberg\u201d late last year.", "While that alone does not point directly towards any obvious explanations, CBC reporter Dean Beeby\u2019s implication that the mission\u2019s launch is now \u201cpostponed\u2026indefinitely\u201d offers a hint of an answer, although it could also be manufactured hyperbole where there actually is none.

In other words, likely out of heaps of caution and conservatism if it is the case, customers CSA and MDA may have requested (or contractually demanded) that SpaceX launch the Radarsat constellation on a flight-proven Falcon 9 with as little wear and tear as possible, in which case B1050 would have been hard to beat.", "If the customers remained steadfast in their (speculated) request for a gently-used flight-proven Falcon 9 even after B1050\u2019s partial landing failure, the next most comparable booster would be Falcon 9 B1051 after launching the first orbital Crew Dragon mission sometime no earlier than (NET) February 2019.

New Glenn and Super Heavy are likely to weigh 50-150+ tons empty.", "The point is that for monolithic objects that are as tall as large rocket boosters, the logistics of actually moving them around can be surprisingly complex and challenging. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Heavy boosters happen to be short enough to be conveniently moved and manipulated by cranes that are quite large but still fairly common and easy enough to lease or purchase. SpaceX consistently uses similar tall, yellow cranes for the process of actually lifting Falcon 9 boosters \u2013 around 30t (~66,000 lbs) dry \u2013 off of their drone ships and onto land, while far smaller wheeled cranes can be used for the process of manipulating Falcon boosters once they are horizontal.", "Given just how relatively light Falcon boosters are compared to their towering height, the cranes that can safely lift such tall and delicate objects tend to be designed to easily lift 5-10X as much weight at once. The next-generation rocket boosters (and even SpaceX\u2019s Starship upper stage) will continue to push the height performance and begin to test the mass capabilities of modern cranes, particularly mobile varieties like the one that just arrived in Port Canaveral. One massive benefit of wheeled cranes like LHM 600 is how versatile and flexible they are, while tracked cranes like the largest ones SpaceX currently uses simply can\u2019t move without risking the destruction of the ground beneath them, requiring that they use advanced mass-spreading technologies (i.e. giant beams of hardwood) wherever they crawl.", "\u00a0", "Liebherr\u2019s mobile harbor cranes offer a far more mobile solution in the form of traditional rubber tires and multiple large spreader plates that can be deployed and retracted when stationary. It will be genuinely interesting to see if SpaceX decides to replace its proven modes of vertical-lift recovery operations to gain the benefits of a crane that is new and an unknown quantity but could still simplify certain recovery operations.

Nevertheless, there are at least as many ways in which the next-gen rocket can (or should) never be able to beat the production cost of what is effectively a far simpler rocket.", "On the one hand, Musk might not necessarily be wrong, especially if one throws the CEO several bones in the interpretation of his brief tweet. BFR at its simplest is going to require a full 38 main rocket engines to achieve its nominal performance goals, 7 on Starship and 31 on Super Heavy. As a dramatically more advanced, larger, and far more complex engine, Raptor will (with very little doubt) cost far more per engine than the relatively simple Merlin 1D. BFR avionics (flight computers, electronics, wiring, harnesses) are likely to be more of a known quantity, meaning that costs will probably be comparable or even lower than Falcon 9\u2019s when measured as a proportion of overall\u00a0vehicle cost. Assuming that BFR can use the exact same cold gas thruster assemblies currently flying on Falcon 9, that cost should only grow proportionally with vehicle size.\u00a0Finally, Starship will not require a deployable payload fairing (~10% of Falcon 9\u2019s production cost).", "All of those things mean that Starship/Super Heavy will probably be starting off with far better cost efficiency than Falcon 9 was able to, thanks to almost a decade of interim experience both building, flying, and refurbishing the rocket since its 2010 debut. Still, BFR will have to account for entirely new structures like six large tripod fins/wings and their actuators, wholly new thrust structures (akin to Falcon 9\u2019s octaweb) for both stages, and more. Considering Starship on its own, the production of a human-rated spacecraft capable of safely housing dozens of people in space for weeks or months will almost without a doubt rival the cost of airliner production, where a 737 \u2013 with almost half a century of production and flight heritage \u2013 still holds a price tag of $100-130+ million.", "\u00a0", "Adding one more assumption, the most lenient interpretation of Musk\u2019s tweet assumes that he is really only subjecting the overall structure (sans engines and any crew-relevant hardware) of BFR relative to Falcon 9. In other words, could a ~300-ton stainless steel rocket structure (BFR) cost the same amount or less to fabricate than a ~30-ton aluminum-lithium alloy rocket structure (Falcon 9/Heavy)? From the very roughest of numerical comparisons, Musk estimated the cost of the stainless steel alloys (300-series) to be used for BFR at around $3 per pound ($6.60/kg), while aluminum-lithium alloys used in aerospace (and on Falcon 9) are sold for around $20/lb ($44/kg)*. As such, simply buying the materials to build the basic structures of BFR and Falcon 9 would cost around and $7.5M and $5M, respectively.", "Assuming that the process of assembling, welding, and integrating Starship and Super Heavy structures is somehow 5-10 times cheaper, easier, and less labor-intensive, it\u2019s actually not inconceivable that the cost of building BFR\u2019s structure could ultimately compete with Falcon 9 after production has stabilized after the new rocket\u2019s prototyping phase is over and manufacturing processes are mature.", "*", "Very rough estimate, difficult to find a public cost per unit mass from modern Al-Li suppliers", "On the opposite hand, stainless steel rockets do not have a history of being uniquely cost-effective relative to vehicles using alternative materials. The only orbital-class launch vehicles to use stainless steel (and balloon) tanks are the Atlas booster and the Centaur upper stage, with Atlas dating back to the late 1950s and Centaur beginning launches in the early \u201960s. Stainless steel Atlas launches ended in 2005 with the final Atlas III mission, while multiple forms of Centaur continue to fly regularly on ULA\u2019s Atlas V and Delta IV.", "Based on a 1966 contract between NASA and General Dynamics placed shortly after Centaur\u2019s tortured development had largely been completed, Centaur upper stages were priced around $25M apiece (2018 USD). In 1980, the hardware for a dedicated Atlas-Centaur launch of a ~1500 kg Comstar I satellite to GTO cost the US the 2018 equivalent of a bit less than $40M ($71M including miscellaneous administrative costs) \u2013 $22.4M for Centaur and $17.6M for Atlas. For Atlas, the rocket\u2019s airframe (tanks and general structure) was purchased for around $8.5M. That version of Atlas-Centaur (Atlas-SLV3D Centaur-D1A) was capable of lifting around 5100 kg (11,250 lb) into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 1800 kg (~4000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), while it stood around 40m (130 ft) tall, had a tank diameter of 3.05m (10 ft), and weighed ~150t (330,000 lb) fully fueled.", "\u00a0", "In a very loose sense, that particular stainless steel Atlas variant was about half as large and half as capable as the first flight-worthy version of Falcon 9 at roughly the same price at launch ($60-70M). What does this jaunt through the history books tell us about the prospects of a stainless steel Starship and Super Heavy? Well, not much. The problem with trying to understand and pick apart official claims about SpaceX\u2019s next-generation launch architecture is quite simple: only one family of rockets in the history of the industry (Atlas) regularly flew with stainless steel propellant tanks, a half-century lineage that completed its\u00a0final launch in 2005.", "Generally speaking, an industrial sample size of more or less one makes it far from easy to come to any particular conclusions about a given technology or practice, and SpaceX \u2013 according to CEO Elon Musk \u2013 fully intends to push past the state of the art of stainless steel rocket tankage with BFR.\u00a0Ultimately, American Marietta/Martin Marietta/Lockheed Martin was never able to produce launch vehicle variants of the stainless steel Atlas family at a cost more than marginally competitive with Falcon 9, despite the latter rocket\u2019s use of a far more expensive metal alloy throughout its primary tanks and structure.", "At some point, it\u2019s even worth asking whether the per-unit cost of Starship and Super Heavy should be relevant at all to their design and construction, at least within reason. If the goal of BFR is to drastically lower the cost of launch by radically improving the ease of reuse, it would be truly bizarre (and utterly unintuitive) if those goals could somehow be achieved without dramatically raising the cost of initial hardware procurement. Perhaps the best close comparison to BFR\u2019s goals, modern airliners are eyewateringly expensive ($100-500M apiece) as a consequence of the extraordinary reliability, performance, efficiency, and longevity customers and regulatory agencies demand from them, although those costs are admittedly not the absolute lowest they could be in a perfect manufacturing scenario.", "At the end of the day, it appears that Musk is increasingly of the opinion that the pivot to stainless steel could ultimately make BFR simultaneously ", "\u201cbetter, faster, [&] cheaper\u201d", ". However improbable that may be, if it does turn out to be the case, Starship and Super Heavy could be an unfathomable leap ahead for reliable and affordable access to space.

SpaceX nevertheless retained the option if customers were to explicitly request it, otherwise wisely concluding (likely with more than a little encouragement from insurance companies) that expediting schedules by a few dozen hours was not worth the entirely\u00a0unnecessary risk to satellite payloads that often cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to build.", "Given that SpaceX has stuck to that practice for all 38 Falcon 9 launches it has performed between Amos-6 and the present day, it seems all but guaranteed that the first orbit-ready Crew Dragon\u2019s presence on Falcon 9 during its static fire has been done only at the specific request of the launch customer \u2013 in this case, NASA.

However, the destruction of the DM-1 capsule and trunk could almost indefinitely delay SpaceX\u2019s first crewed launch, dependent upon an inflight-abort test that is supposed to use the refurbished DM-1 capsule, while the Crew Dragon currently supposed to launch after DM-2 is unlikely to be ready before August or September 2019.", "\u00a0", "Ultimately, NASA likely requested that Crew Dragon remain atop Falcon 9 for this static fire out of some desire for a full-fidelity test environment and complement of data.

At the end of the day, Musk very well might be correct when he states that a stainless steel Starship can ultimately be\u00a0", "more", " mass-efficient (\u201clighter\u201d) than a Starship built out of advanced carbon composites, a characteristic he rightly describes as \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d.", "Based on research done in the 2010s by German space agency (DLR), a porous thermal protection material called\u00a0Procelit 170 (P170) \u2013 91% aluminum oxide and 9% silicon oxide \u2013 was cooled from a peak heat of ~1750 C (3200 F) to ~25 C (75 F) during wind tunnel testing, demonstrating that an average of 0.065 kg (~2.3 oz) of water per second would be needed to cool a square meter of P170 to the same degree, assuming a heating rate of around 200 kW/m^2. Given that 300-series stainless steels have a comparatively huge capacity\u00a0for radiating heat at high temperatures, will be dramatically thinner than Procelit\u00a0in any given Starship use-case, and will not need to be cooled all the way to 25C/75F during hot operations, the DLR-derived number is barely relevant without another round of wind tunnel tests focused on metallic thermal protection systems. Still, it allows for the creation of a sort of worst-case scenario for BFS/Starship\u2019s water-cooled\u00a0shield.", "Assuming that the windward side of Starship\u2019s regeneratively cooled heat shield has roughly the same surface area as half of a cylinder, 800 m^2 (8600 ft^2) will have to be actively cooled with water, translating to a water consumption rate of approximately 52 kg/s (115 lb/s) if the entire surface is being subjected to temperatures around ~1750 C. That is, of course, a grossly inaccurate generalization, as aerodynamic surfaces dramatically shape, dissipate, and concentrate airflows (and thus heat from friction) in complex and highly specific ways. Much like NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle or DLR\u2019s theoretical SpaceLiner, the reality of reentry heating is that that heat typically ends up being focused at leading edges and control surfaces, which thus require uniquely capable versions of thermal protection (TPS). Shuttle used fragile reinforced carbon-carbon tiles at those hotspots, while DLR was exploring water cooling as a viable and safer alternative for SpaceLiner.", "\u00a0", "Aside from heat flux,\u00a0it\u2019s also unclear when or how long the cooling system will need to be supplied with water during potential Starship reentries. At worst, the spacecraft would need to supply a constant 50+ kg/s throughout a 5+ minute (600+ second) regime of high-velocity, high-drag reentry conditions. Assuming that Starship will need to rely\u00a0heavily on aerobraking to maintain efficient interplanetary operations, it might have to perform 2+ active-cooling cycles per reentry, potentially requiring a minimum of 15 tons of water per reentry. Given that SpaceX intends (at least as of September 2018) for Starship to be able to land more than 100 tons on the surface of Mars, 15t of water would cut drastically into payload margins and is thus likely an unfeasibly large mass reserve or any given interplanetary mission.", "\u201cYou just need, essentially, [a stainless-steel sandwich].

Ostello expressed a similar interest and optimism a few weeks prior to that announcement.

This is undoubtedly an extraordinarily aggressive test program, particularly for such a new and cutting-edge rocket propulsion system, but these latest developments are ultimately far more encouraging than they are concerning.", "Although the Raptor engine family began integrated subscale static fires way back in September 2016, SpaceX\u2019s propulsion team finalized Raptor\u2019s baseline design and completed assembly, shipment, and an integrated static fire of the first full-scale engine on February 3rd, considerably less than three weeks before Musk took to Twitter.

One prime example hinted at by Musk in a 2018 tweet is its oxygen preburner, used to convert liquid propellant into a high-velocity gas that can then feed a dedicated oxygen turbopump. Aside from the absurdly corrosive environment created by extremely hot gaseous oxygen, the preburner must also survive pressures that could peak as high as 800+ bar, or 12,000 psi.", "\u00a0", "A lack of technical detail means that it\u2019s hard to know what thrust or main chamber pressure Musk had in mind when referring to exotic alloys that would be needed to survive those pressures, but the performance statistics of a Raptor with a preburner operating at 800+ bar would probably outstrip anything Musk has thus far described. In other words, it\u2019s safe to assume that Raptor has probably not been pushed to those performance levels just yet, although it\u2019s still a distant possibility. More likely is that 800+ bar in the oxygen preburner is an extreme stretch-goal that will take concerted research, development, and optimization to achieve, with Raptor having suffered damage somewhere below those levels while still reaching eye-watering performance figures.", "For an engine as complex as Raptor, there are countless dozens of potential failure modes the appearance of which would come as little surprise for an engine just days into full-scale testing. Above all else, the Raptor test schedule held by SpaceX\u2019s world-class propulsion team \u2013 be it self-motivated or driven by reckless management-by-spreadsheet \u2013 has been fast-paced in the extreme, taking the first high-performance Raptor ever built from standstill to more than 90% thrust and chamber pressures of almost 270 bar (3900 psi) in \u2013 quite literally \u2013 less than one week. In the same period of time, more than half a dozen static fire tests (ranging from 1-10 seconds) were performed.", "Within a few days of that February 10th milestone, in which Raptor reached chamber pressures comparable with the most advanced modern engines (namely RD-180/190/191), the engine was apparently pushed dramatically higher still, reaching a chamber pressure (and thus thrust) that wrought damage on some of the more sensitive parts of the engine\u2019s plumbing. Despite the fact that the second production Raptor is apparently already \u201calmost done\u201d, Musk suggested that it would already feature changes (of unknown gravity) to mitigate the failure modes experienced by Raptor SN01.", "In an industry where NASA and contractors like Aerojet-Rocketdyne will spend months between static fire tests of Space Shuttle engines that have each literally flown multiple (if not) dozens of missions to orbit and have a demonstrated performance and reliability record that is measured in the hundreds of thousands of seconds, the speed and agility of SpaceX\u2019s Raptor development and test program is breathtaking. What remains to be seen is just how comparably reliable and successful the end results (i.e. operational Raptor) will be, but an attitude that actively accepts and even pursues testing to destruction can ultimately only serve to benefit the finished product at the cost of destroyed hardware and many on-ground lessons learned the hard ways.", "Given the immense success of SpaceX\u2019s Merlin family of engines and the aggressive strategy of development and continuous improvement that brought it from Merlin 1A to 1D and MVacD, SpaceX is clearly not fumbling around in the dark when it comes to Raptor R&D.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes!"]},

Meant to be the first mission to utilize subcooled propellant and oxidizer, the extreme cold in the upper stage LOx tank caused solid oxygen to form on the outside of the COPVs located inside it. While complex, the gist was that liquid (and perhaps solid) oxygen could have formed around the outside of the COPV, potentially finding its way in between the carbon fiber wrappings, creating a buckle in the fibers, and ultimately causing fibers to break. Near the end of this process, those breaking fibers could have created a spark or breached the helium tank, instantaneously overpressurizing the upper stage and causing an explosion.", "NASA\u2019s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) and NASA itself have aired concerns about those COPVs since 2016, triggering an extraordinarily comprehensive program of testing, characterization, and redesign of the COPVs SpaceX uses.

To verify the operational integrity of Starhopper and iron out best practices for what is effectively a one-off mobile test stand for Raptor, these WDRs (and one more active test) have seen the unusual prototype filled with some amount of liquid oxygen and methane propellant, taken to flight (hop?) pressures, and generally monitored closely to gather valuable telemetry and judge Starhopper\u2019s condition and hop-readiness. Aside from Hopper, these tests also serve as a shakedown for complex pad and support facilities sprung up from a dirt pile in barely three months.", "Starhopper\u2019s five (ish) wet dress rehearsal tests have demonstrated an intriguing level of caution relative to the last few months of BFR program development.

In other words, these ~5 WDR tests could have been the plan all along, or each test could be producing data that has lead launch engineers to scrub Raptor ignition attempts nominally planned at the end of each rehearsal. For an entirely new and unfamiliar design like Starhopper, it seems likely that at least one or two WDRs were planned before any attempt to static fire the hopper\u2019s lone Raptor, although it could also be the case that \u2013 much like most SpaceX static fire attempts \u2013 the WDR was simply built in as a precursor to ignition, barring off-nominal telemetry.

Based on the vehicle\u2019s appearance and the apparent decision to entirely set aside the idea of installing a new fairing on Starhopper, it seems far more plausible that the prototype is more of a glorified mobile test stand for Raptor engines and Starship avionics (software) than anything else.", "If Starhopper really can\u2019t function as something more than a marginally mobile test stand for Raptor(s), then the value of actually hopping the craft could be quite minimal, perhaps offering useful data on Raptor\u2019s control loop and behavior during flight operations. Still, CEO Elon Musk has stated several times that SpaceX has gotten good enough at the actual task of landing rockets vertically that it\u2019s effectively a known quantity for Raptor and BFR, whereas the exotic atmospheric operations planned for Starship are the main uncertainty for successful recoveries.

It\u2019s likely that Starhopper\u2019s career will thus end up being rather short, given that the completion of the first near-final Starship would further minimize the low-fidelity hopper\u2019s utility. If it\u2019s actually meant to reach orbit, the newest Starship prototype will require the tripod fins and canard wings shown in SpaceX\u2019s latest renders in order to safely land for future test flights, while Starhopper appears to be far too heavy and simplistic to warrant the expensive and time-consuming task of outfitting it with aerodynamic control surfaces and a new nose cone capable of surviving the associated forces.

SpaceX did not begin to receive rewards or dedicated Crew Dragon-related funding until April 2011, when NASA awarded the company $75M to develop the spacecraft\u2019s proposed integral abort system, relying on a newly developed Super Draco engine. In August 2012, NASA awarded Sierra Nevada, SpaceX, and Boeing several hundred million dollars each to continue serious development of their respective crewed spacecraft and launch vehicles, followed in 2014 by firm\u00a0long-term contracts with SpaceX and Boeing to bring their Crew Dragon and Starliner vehicles to fruition.", "\u00a0", "Of note, SpaceX\u2019s contract was valued at $2.6B, while Boeing received $4.2B, a full 60% more to complete an effectively identical task. Sadly, the US Congress systematically underfunded CCP during its formative years, largely a consequence of entrenched political and financial interests in preferentially funding NASA\u2019s own SLS rocket and crewed Orion spacecraft above and at the cost of other rocket and spacecraft development initiatives. Insufficient funding likely contributed\u00a0heavily to the years of delays subsequently suffered by the program and its commercial providers, pushing a nominal launch debut target from 2015 to 2017 before ultimately moving to 2018 and finally 2019, largely a result\u00a0of unsurprising technical challenges faced by each provider as they entered into hardware- and testing-rich phases of development.", "After approximately 5-6 years of concerted work, SpaceX and NASA are now as ready as they\u2019ll ever be to conduct the first orbital launch of the Commercial Crew Program, to be followed as early as by Boeing\u2019s own uncrewed orbital demonstration of its Starliner spacecraft. For those that have followed CCP for even part of its years-long saga, it\u2019s more than a little surreal to be faced with the reality that such a milestone is barely two days distant.", "Meanwhile, SpaceX\u2019s leased Pad 39A launch complex has undergone its own significant changes. Dating back to NASA\u2019s Apollo Program, Pad 39A supported all but one of Saturn V\u2019s 13 launches and more than 80 Space Shuttle launches before SpaceX took over the pad in 2014. In the five years the company has leased the facility, a range of changes have been made to the pad\u2019s hardware, support facilities, and the primary metalwork known as service structures, one fixed (FSS) and one rolling (RSS). Aside from a bare skeleton of the RSS hinge, SpaceX has completely removed several hundred tons of Shuttle support hardware, while the FSS (the skyscraper-like rectangular tower) has remained largely unchanged, aside from the installation of a new level and Crew Dragon\u2019s Crew Access Arm (CAA) on the ~110m (350 ft) tower.", "\u00a0", "Most recently, the company has pursued a series of visually distinct changes to tower, painting it almost entirely black with white highlights and installing partially transparent black plexiglass panels along the full length of at least 2-3 of its four walls. While the paint color is almost certainly aesthetically motivated (it matches Falcon 9, Crew Dragon, and the access arm), the decision to enclose all or most of the FSS will likely be very well received the astronauts and technicians it will ultimately support, especially if SpaceX manages to keep out Florida\u2019s notorious mosquitoes.", "If SpaceX\u2019s uncrewed DM-1 Crew Dragon demonstration is a success, the company could follow it up with Crew Dragon\u2019s first launch with astronauts aboard as early as July 2019, officially returning 39A to active place in human spaceflight and marking the end of more than eight years spent without a domestic solution for transporting US astronauts into orbit.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes!"]},

Matters of accessibility aside, SpaceX\u2019s updated render offers a spectacular view of Starship\u2019s exotic metallic heat shield in action, superheating the atmosphere around it to form a veil of plasma around the spacecraft\u2019s hull.

Aside from its shiny steel exterior, this latest render also offers an exceptionally-illustrated artist\u2019s interpretation of what a Starship with metallic thermal protection might look like during reentry, appearing to take into account a number of things that set such a system apart from traditional heat shielding.", "Aside from NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle, which used fragile tiles of insulating material in its reusable heat shield, no other spacecraft have been flown with a primary heat shields that experiences little to no ablation, meaning that the material itself is not eroded during peak heating. Ablative heat shields like the PICA-X system used on SpaceX\u2019s Crew and Cargo Dragons produce distinctly different \u2018tails\u2019 during reentry, mainly as a result of the addition of ablated material, much like injecting different elements into a fire or using different materials in rocket nozzles can drastically change the color (and sometimes behavior) of the flame. ", "While the extreme compressive heating of spacecraft reentering Earth\u2019s atmosphere at many miles/kilometers per second produces plasma instead of what humans recognize as fire, the general idea remains the same. Comparing the reentry tails of spacecraft like the Apollo Command Module, the Space Shuttle, and Orion makes it clear that each vehicle and heat shield produces a subtle but distinctly unique plasma tail over the course of several minutes of peak reentry heating, when the vehicle\u2019s velocity is fast enough to compress atmospheric gases into plasma. Different ablators end up injecting different gases into the superheated plasma tail, hence the different appearance of each tail.", "Aside from a unique lack of ablation for Starship\u2019s stainless steel hull and curious hexagonal steel heat shield tiles, SpaceX may end up having to implement a wholly unproven technology known as transpiration cooling, in which some of ", "Starship\u2019s", " liquid methane propellant would be intentionally pushed out from micro-scale holes drilled or perhaps laser-cut in certain hexagonal plates. After traveling through the steel skin/shield and out of the holes, the liquid methane would almost instantly vaporize into gas and then plasma as it confronts the spacecraft\u2019s superheated bow shock wave, reducing the thermal loads on tiles with such an active cooling solution installed. ", "It\u2019s unclear what the resulting methane-rich plasma plume might look like but it\u2019s not out of the question that SpaceX\u2019s graphic design team have either done the math themselves, so to speak, or asked engineers to verify what color Starship\u2019s plasma tail might end up looking like. As shown in the latest render, a plume of hues ranging from light blue and indigo to red through white seems entirely plausible. Regardless, Starship is bound to look spectacular during orbital reentries thanks to its metallic skin and shield and planned hot structure, meaning that the entire windward half of the vehicle could end up glowing red, orange, yellow, and even white-hot, precisely like the thermal testing video Musk recently shared.", "SpaceX\u2019s first orbital Starship prototype is already under construction at the company\u2019s ad-hoc South Texas \u2018shipyard\u2019, for lack of a better term.

", "Even as SpaceX\u2019s longer-term development groups aim to make the company\u2019s Dragon spacecraft all but redundant with Starship and Super Heavy, the apparent success of Crew Dragon\u2019s upgrades will be valuable for years to come. Ultimately, \u201cmajor\u201d improvements in reusability will allow SpaceX to reuse Dragon 2 far more efficiently, improving availability for both its Crew and Cargo programs and potentially cutting the operating cost and longevity of each spacecraft as the company begins to transition its workforce to BFR. ", "Although the question ", "cuing", " Musk was non-specific, the SpaceX CEO immediately focused his reply on whether or not unspecified \u201cupgrades\u201d to Crew Dragon were able to keep sensitive hardware dry. SpaceX\u2019s Cargo Dragon program has roughly seven years of experience with launching, recovering, and refurbishing orbital-class spacecraft after ocean landings and the subsequent seawater immersion. The fact that the Dragon 2 concept was almost immediately demonstrated with propulsive land-landing capabilities speaks to just how annoying a problem it was to try to keep an orbital spacecraft easily reusable while still relying upon water landing for recovery. ", "As it turns out, many of the engineering solutions best known to ensure structural and thermal integrity of a spacecraft on-orbit are often at ends with the separate task of ensuring that the same spacecraft remains thoroughly water-proof through launch, reentry, and splashdown. Many of these problems center around the materials that are best for each solution. The sorts of polymers (i.e. plastics) best known for their roles in sealing certain things off from other things are frequently very pliable, soft, and flexible. The orbital environment is extremely unfriendly to polymers like this, where constant and extreme thermal cycling couples with vacuum, radiation, and something ", "known", " as atomic (or free radical) oxygen to rapidly turn pliable polymers brittle. ", "A \u2018brittle seal\u2019, as many will know, is an oxymoron. Sealants that become brittle in space often scarcely behave like sealants at all after weeks (or months) in orbit, meaning that their ability to prevent moisture intrusion can be dramatically deteriorated. From an engineering perspective, Crew Dragon\u2019s many seals and gaskets are first and foremost intended to protect the spacecraft from the elements while still on Earth, where static fire attempts and weather during launch windows could require it to weather extreme heat, cold, rainstorms, ice, and high winds. SpaceX engineers appear to have managed to solve the latter problem while also accounting for a need to protect the spacecraft ", "after", " launch for the sake of easier refurbishment.", "However, sealing the spacecraft from the elements \u2013 both before and after launch \u2013 is just one of many challenges for safe operations and efficient reusability. Up next, as Musk notes, is protecting Crew Dragon\u2019s 16 Draco maneuvering thrusters and 8 SuperDraco abort thrusters from water damage, as well as sealing off vulnerable avionics for reuse. With respect to avionics, Musk is very likely referring to the electronics and sensing equipment housed under Dragon 2\u2019s retractable nose cone, a new feature for SpaceX.  ", "Due to the fact that Crew Dragon\u2019s SuperDraco abort thrusters are only meant to be used in a namesake abort scenario, SpaceX appears to have chosen to implement a more permanent solution for protecting them from water intrusion after splashdown. The challenge of panels like those covering the SuperDracos is that they need to be easily destructible to prevent a cascade of high-velocity debris from wreaking havoc in the event of ignition. They also need to survive the conditions on orbit, make it through the heat and buffeting of reentry and ", "descent,", " and survive the initial impact with the ocean surface, all while keeping SuperDracos dry. ", "As such, it should come as no surprise to find CEO Elon Musk praising the engineering behind the presumably successful solutions to these complex problems, although credit is also due to the technicians that turned CAD files, test results, and aspirations into practical, functioning hardware. ", "If Crew Dragon can achieve a similar level of success after spending more like half a year in space during operational crew transport missions, the spacecraft\u2019s reusability improvements will end up benefiting both Crew Dragon and Cargo Dragon 2.

Outer planets \u2013 those lying beyond the Solar System\u2019s main asteroid belt \u2013 are a minimum of 400 million miles (~650 million km) from Earth and stretch out to bodies like 2014 MU69 (below) at 4+ billion miles (6.8+ billion km) beyond Earth\u2019s orbit. To travel those truly absurd distances, the time-to-destination can often be measured in decades, a timeframe that is physically impossible to shrink without hugely powerful rockets like BFR. Even then, SpaceX would face major hurdles to pull off Musk\u2019s impromptu mission design.", "New Horizons, the tiny but amazing spacecraft responsible for the first-ever close-up photos of Pluto and (more recently) the bizarre MU69 comet/asteroid, is perhaps the best categorical example of what Musk is proposing. Weighing less than 480 kg (1060 lb) and powered by a radioisotope generator (RTG), the spacecraft was launched in January 2006 and \u2013 after a single gravity assist around Jupiter \u2013 flew by Pluto a bit less than ten years later in July 2015, traveling a blistering ~13.8 km/s (8.6 mi/s). ", "Coincidentally, at least the first prototypes of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite constellation weighed around 400 kg (880 lb) during their March 2018 launch, just shy of New Horizons\u2019 own dry mass. Major differences abound, however. Most notably, Starlink satellites will be powered by solar arrays optimized for energy generation at Earth\u2019s distance from the sun, compared to New Horizons\u2019 RTG reactor. At distances beyond Saturn, reliance on solar power would be an extraordinary challenge for any spacecraft hoping to do more than simply survive. For example, due to certain unforgiving laws of physics, New Horizons would receive \u2013 quite literally \u2013 0.06% the solar energy per unit of area at Pluto. ", "To produce the scant ~300 Watts New Horizon receives from its nuclear power source, a single Starlink satellite would need a minimum of 1400 m^2 (~15,000 ft^2) of high-efficiency solar panels to survive and power a minimal suite of instruments and communications hardware. Assuming an extraordinary 170 g/m^2 solar array as proposed by Alta Devices, a Starlink satellite would need solar cells weighing no less than 250 kg (550 lb) total to operate at Pluto, a mass that absolutely does not factor in the complex mechanisms necessary to deploy a third of an acre of solar panels from an area of just a few cubic meters.", "Frankly put, solar-powered exploration beyond the orbit of Jupiter and perhaps Saturn becomes almost inconceivably difficult. Further, the above numbers don\u2019t even take into account each Starlink spacecraft\u2019s electric thrusters, which would need several times more solar panels or massive batteries (themselves needing heaters) to operate at an optimal power level for long, uninterrupted periods of time, a necessity for electric propulsion. Several billion miles closer to the sun, in the main asteroid belt or around the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, solar power is still extremely challenging but not impossible.

While the challenges are immense, the fact that Mr. Musk is already expressing interest in supporting such an exploratory, science-focused mission inspires confidence in the many future benefits that could soon be derived from Starlink and Starship, if successfully developed. Assuming missions that remain within the Inner Solar System, an exploration architecture as described by Musk is already readily doable and wouldn\u2019t need the major modifications and leaps necessary for Outer Solar System ventures. Possible destinations where it could be practical include the Moon, Mars, Venus, the main asteroid belt (i.e. Ceres, Vesta, etc.), and many others.

In other words, he is essentially playing his crowds and tweaking messages to better resonate with certain types of stakeholders. Relatively new for a NASA administrator, it remains to be seen whether his unfamiliar approach will produce serious results.", "Sitting before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee on March 13th, he announced the commercial Orion launch study as a token of recognition that NASA needs to get better at staying on-schedule and on-budget for US taxpayers and Congressional purse string-holders. After the US Vice President challenged NASA to return humans to the Moon with any means necessary by 2024, Bridenstine affirmed that NASA would do everything in its power to meet that charge, including the exploitation of commercial alternatives. In a March 27th hearing before members of Congress with explicit stakes in the SLS rocket\u2019s pork, he barely mentioned commercial alternatives for Orion EM-1, instead focusing on a paired study aiming to accelerate the SLS launch debut schedule while also reiterating his confidence that Boeing and other contractors can rise to the occasion. ", "In his latest April 1st comments on commercial launch alternatives for Orion\u2019s Moon mission debut, Bridenstine spoke to nearly all of NASA\u2019s major center, program, and directive managers and stuck to the technical facts of the matters at hand. He repeatedly acknowledged that both launching an uncrewed Orion spacecraft to the Moon before the end of 2020 and returning astronauts to its surface by the end of 2024 would be extraordinary challenges and could require far-reaching changes and reforms throughout NASA. He also reaffirmed his intent to ensure that ", "nothing", " be taken off the table as an option to accomplish those ambitious goals. This included an indication that (in more polite terms, of course) the ", "spectre", " of Falcon Heavy would continue to hang over the heads of Boeing and the SLS program moving forward, a new and constant reminder that failure to be cost-efficient and stay on-schedule from now on could necessitate actions that would make SLS almost entirely redundant.", "We see, in history, that in the past we have had an agenda to get to the Moon and then the resources don\u2019t materialize and it gets canceled, and then we have another agenda to go to the Moon and the resources don\u2019t materialize and it gets canceled. From my perspective, it is my objective to get the resources necessary to accomplish [this goal]. It is also my commitment to make sure that people understand the history here and that we can have a great, ambitious goal, but without the resources, it won\u2019t be accomplished.", "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, 04/01/2019", "The specifics of what the NASA administrator briefly hinted at for a Falcon Heavy launch of EM-1 are spectacular enough to warrant additional discussion. According to Bridenstine, the two-week study NASA conducted essentially concluded that ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy rocket was not a practical option for several major reasons. First, it seems that NASA has little to no confidence that Lockheed Martin and its contractors would be able to retrofit EM-1\u2019s Orion and European Service Module (ESM) with the hardware and software needed for on-orbit rendezvous with a boost stage in time for a 2020 launch. Those capabilities were not planned for Orion until EM-3, NET 2024 in an absolute best-case scenario. This would entirely preclude a distributed launch solution, regardless of whether Delta IV Heavy is capable of placing the payloads in orbit.", "Even if a rendezvous was on the table, a distributed launch scenario would still be impossible with either two Falcon Heavies or Delta IV Heavies, as both launches would have to occur as close to simultaneously as possible \u2013 optimally just a few hours apart. SpaceX has only one pad capable of supporting Falcon Heavy, while ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy has two pads, but only one that can launch to the required orbit. A bigger problem: Delta IV Heavy is capable of launching no more than ~28,400 kg (63,000 lb) to an altitude of ~200 km (120 mi), which definitely rules out a Delta IV Heavy launch of the ICPS upper stage (~30,000 kg, 66,000 lb) and could also fall short for Orion/ESM (~26,000 kg, 57,000 lb), assuming that both would need to be launched to an elliptical orbit of 1800 km (1150 mi). ", "Due to NASA\u2019s implied assumption that on-orbit rendezvous of Orion and a booster stage is out of the question and the potential performance shortcomings of Delta IV Heavy, as well as Falcon Heavy\u2019s inability to launch Orion/ESM towards lunar orbit, only one option apparently remains. According to Bridenstine, NASA concluded that a mission profile in which Falcon Heavy places Orion, a service module, ", "and ", "an ICPS upper stage in orbit in ", "a single launch", " may actually be a serious option \u2013 and the only option \u2013 for a near-term commercial alternative for Orion\u2019s first operational test flight. The unofficial graphic above offers a rough glimpse of what that massive payload might look like atop Falcon Heavy.", "[Finally]", ", there is another solution out there: a Falcon Heavy with an ICPS at the top \u2013 talk about strange bedfellows \u2013 and an ESM and Orion crew capsule. That ultimately has the ability to potentially \u2013 gosh, [NASA Associate Administrator Bill] Gerst is gonna be so mad at me for saying all of this\u2026 by the way, none of this was cleared by Gerstenmaier, he\u2019s still the best rocket scientist we have [camera pans to Gerst, laughter], no insult to anyone else in the room \u2013 so, at the end of the day, there is a solution here that could potentially work for the future. ", "It would require time, it would require cost, and there is risk involved, but guess what? If we\u2019re gonna land boots on the Moon in 2024, we have time, and we have the ability to accept some risk and make some modifications. All of that is on the table. There is nothing sacred here that is off the table, and [FH+ICPS+Orion/ESM] is a potential capability that could help us land on the Moon in 2024.", " NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, 04/01/2019 ", "Combined, the Orion spacecraft, its ESM, and a fueled ICPS boost stage would weigh no less than 56,000 kg (~123,000 lb) at launch, relative to Falcon Heavy\u2019s reported expendable performance of about 64,000 kg (140,000 lb) to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In other words, it\u2019s possible that Falcon Heavy could effectively do the exact same job as SLS would need to do to perform a nominal Orion EM-1 orbital insertion. However, a huge number of challenges remain for such an exotic Falcon Heavy configuration. Pad 39A would need to be outfitted with an array of systems, including a liquid hydrogen propellant plant and the ability to load Orion and its service module with hypergolic propellant while atop Falcon Heavy and vertical on the pad. To allow for vertical Orion/ESM/ICPS processing and fueling and support the massive weight and height (~95m vs. 70m) of the vehicle, the transporter-erector would need to be heavily modified. Additionally, Falcon Heavy\u2019s aerodynamic characteristics would need to be entirely reanalyzed for such a significantly taller payload fairing. ", "But, as Bridenstine made clear above, those challenges would be par for the course of accomplishing something as audacious as returning humans to the Moon in less than six years. Whether or not NASA actually pursues or Congress funds such an alternative beyond the drawing board, the cat is now officially out of the bag. A potentially satisfactory replacement for SLS will now hang over the program\u2019s head for the indefinite future, a constant threat in the (quite likely) event that the many SLS/Orion contractors fail \u2013 once again \u2013  to even loosely adhere to their budget and schedule targets.

With anywhere from 4400 to nearly 12,000 satellites needed to complete the three major proposed phases of Starlink, SpaceX will have to build and launch a minimum of ~2200 satellites in the next five years, averaging 37 high-performance, low-cost spacecraft built and launched every month for the next 60 months.", "Despite the major challenges ahead of SpaceX, things seem to be going quite smoothly with the current mix of manufacturing and development. As previously reported on Teslarati, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk forced the Starlink group through a painful reorganization in the summer of 2018, challenging the remaining leaders and their team to launch the first batch of operational Starlink satellites no later than June 2019. As a consequence, a sort of compromise had to be reached where one additional group of quasi-prototype satellites would be launched before settling on a truly final design for serious mass-production. ", "According to SpaceX filings with the FCC, the first group of operational satellites \u2013 potentially anywhere from 75 to 1000 or more \u2013 will rely on just one band (\u201cKu\u201d) for communications instead of the nominal two (\u201cKu\u201d and \u201cKa\u201d), a change that SpaceX says will significantly simplify the first spacecraft. By simplifying them, SpaceX believes it can expedite Starlink\u2019s initial deployment without losing a great deal of performance or interfering with constellations from competitors like OneWeb. ", "Somewhere along the line, SpaceX would iteratively improve each subsequent \u2018generation\u2019 of Starlink satellites until they reached the nominal performance characteristics outlined in the company\u2019s original constellation application. Knowing SpaceX, improvements would continue for as long as lessons continued to be learned from operating hundreds and eventually thousands of orbital spacecraft.

After those first 75 spacecraft are built and launched, SpaceX will introduce upgrades \u2013 already planned and designed \u2013 that will reduce the surviving reentry debris (and thus their risk to humans below) to zero. ", "While the FCC has yet to grant SpaceX\u2019s requested modifications, the other major goal is to reduce the operating orbit of the first phase of 1584 satellites to 550 km (340 mi), a change that SpaceX says will drastically reduce the potential lifespan of any orbital debris in the unlikely event of their creation. A lower altitude also places a major cushion between SpaceX\u2019s first ~1500 satellites and the orbits of several other planned constellations, including OneWeb and Telesat. ", "Meanwhile, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink program has begun the often painful steps of transitioning from a venture primarily focused on research and development to one focused mainly on building production lines and supply chains and manufacturing hardware. SpaceX\u2019s Starlink facilities are currently housed in three nearby buildings located in Redmond, Washington, likely offering approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m^2) for a mix of office, development, and production spaces. At least one of the three non-office buildings could potentially become dedicated to production while one building \u2013 approximately 40,000 ft^2 (~3500 m^2) \u2013 has already been completely transformed into a prototype of a Starlink satellite production line, supporting manufacturing for first several dozen quasi-prototype spacecraft. For reference, ", "OneWeb\u2019s", " dedicated satellite factory will feature around 100,000 square feet of space dedicated primarily to production, while the constellation\u2019s satellites will be roughly half as large as SpaceX\u2019s proposed Starlink satellites (~400 kg, 880 lb). ", "Mass-producing spacecraft at the scale needed to build even half of those needed for the first phase of ~4400 Starlink satellites will be a feat unprecedented in the history of the space industry. Barring FCC exemptions (possible but unlikely), SpaceX needs to launch ~2200 Starlink satellites between now and April 2024. To complete the first phase, the final number of satellites rises to ~4400. Adding on a proposed constellation of very low Earth orbit (", "VLEO", ") Starlink satellites, that number rises once more to a bit less than 12,000. Meanwhile, the cost of the satellites needs to be kept as low as possible while their performance is maximized. To put it in automotive terms, SpaceX needs to find a way to do the satellite equivalent of going from building Tesla\u2019s original Roadster to the 2020 Roadster in just a handful of iterative generations and a few years.

This particular first stage, 1029, is coincidentally symbolic in the sense that it launched SpaceX\u2019s first mission after the Amos-6 failure last year, when\u00a0a complex series of events led to a massive explosion that destroyed Falcon 9, the Amos-6 payload, and severely damaged the site\u00a0it was to launch from. Elon Musk deemed it \u201cthe most difficult and complex failure\u201d SpaceX had ever faced.

This activity, as well as Elon Musk\u2019s ", "Ask Me Anything", "\u00a0on ", "/r/SpaceX", ", occurred a month or two after the 2016 IAC, in October and November.", "The only concrete information revealed about SpaceX\u2019s Mars ambitions in 2017 have so far been distributed by Musk over Twitter and in\u00a0an interview of SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell a few weeks ago. Musk offered tentative time frames for a possible update of the Mars architecture, stating that he believed it dealt with the far more crucial challenge of how to finance such a large endeavor\u2019s significant R&D costs.", "During his 2016 reveal, Musk estimated that something like $10 billion would be required to complete development and initial construction of the Raptor engine and ITS test articles. While it is believed that SpaceX has at least several hundred million dollars of liquid capital available, growing several billion dollars of capital is a much greater challenge that will likely require a different methodology than those typically employed by Musk.", "Shotewell\u00a0also discussed SpaceX\u2019s Mars ambitions off and on during\u00a0an hour-long interview on The Space Show. Of general interest, she mentioned that the current team working on Mars-related\u00a0research and development was \u201ctiny\u201d, but that it would become a drastically more resource-intensive priority as the company completes work on the fifth and somewhat final \u201cBlock\u201d of Falcon 9 and finishes the work necessary to begin routinely conducting Commercial Crew missions. Shotwell gave a timeline of \u201csoon\u201d for the beginning of Block 4 flights and \u201cend of year\u201d for the introduction of Block 5, which is intended to significantly increase the reusability of Falcon 9 (titanium grid fins are a feature of this strategy). Barring delays or setbacks for SpaceX, this implies that SpaceX will begin aggressively pursuing the concrete development of their Mars architecture as soon as the latter months of 2018 or sometime in 2019.", "More specifically, however, Shotwell said that the Raptor test article revealed at the Guadalajara IAC has since conducted \u201cdozens\u201d of tests and is now more seriously considering the engine\u2019s potential utility aboard Falcon 9. The current subscale Raptor components are approximately half the size of the final, operational design, and the need to scale up by as little as a factor of 2 should make the realization of the final design considerably less difficult, and make the testing of the current Raptor far more demonstrative of the operational engine. The exploration of vacuum Raptor as the engine of an upgraded second stage for Falcon 9 would further allow for true on-orbit testing of Raptor, and increasing the performance of S2 would allow for greater flexibility in exploring second stage reuse. Musk and Shotwell have expressed interest in this, particularly given that the second stage is approximately 30% of the cost of every Falcon 9, thus capping any potential cost savings first stage (and fairing) reuse may bring. If SpaceX wishes to lower the cost of launches by a factor of 10 to 100 and bring to life any form of the Mars architecture revealed in Guadalajara, they will have to develop second stage reusability that it is both as rapid, functional, and complete as they soon hope to make first stage reuse.", "A fully reusable Falcon 9 would offer the company more cost-effective ways to launch their own profit-driving internet constellation, and could also simply provide deeper profit margins for their main business of commercial launches. However, with Musk having already publicly acknowledged that reusability cost SpaceX approximately $1 billion to develop, SpaceX is certainly already considering the plausibly diminishing returns of diverting more funds and human resources into the continued development of Falcon 9. The most likely outcome is almost certainly some combination of the above goals, whereby SpaceX would delay their Mars exploration timeline by several years and concurrently pursue Falcon 9 second stage reuse and the initial test article development for their Mars architecture, as well as exploring the challenges and intricacies of human spaceflight and deep space exploration with Dragon v2.", "\u00a0", "Of note, the only known\u00a0major testing event in 2017 related to SpaceX\u2019s Mars program\u00a0was observed by a SpaceX fan in February of this year. After successful November 2016 tests of the carbon composite tank in northern Washington state, fans noted that the tank had made an outdoors appearance once more in early February 2017. SpaceX mentioned on Instagram that the following test, the one SpaceX was preparing for in February, was a full cryo test of the tank, meaning that it involved actual high-pressure, supercooled liquid oxygen. Another fan noted several days later that the barge SpaceX was testing the tank aboard returned to port empty, and later observed what looked like several large pieces of the tank\u00a0test article that reportedly had to be recovered from the sound by divers. The logical conclusion is that the tank was destroyed during its second phase of testing, but the crucial and currently unknown fact of the matter is whether the failure was a result of intentionally destructive testing or defects in what was effectively an experimental engineering article. Further SpaceX talks later this year will likely reveal some level of detail as to what transpired in the testing of that prototype carbon composite tank.", "Reasoned speculation aside, the latter months of 2017\u00a0have multiple talks, speeches, and hearings planned by SpaceX members like Elon Musk and Tim Hughes, and information on SpaceX\u2019s Mars ambitions and other future prospects will almost certainly be offered. Hughes is to attend a hearing at 9am EST on July 13th for the U.S. Senate on commercial space and will be testifying on the subject as a representative and employee of SpaceX.

Judging from the new net\u2019s beefy rigging, broader bars, and general appearance, one could safely argue that it looks at least several times stronger than the mesh net before it. One could also argue that the absolutely massive metal arms installed on Mr. Steven are far larger than what might be required to catch the extremely low mass-to-area ratio payload fairings, with structural heft and bulky netting more reminiscent of safety nets present on naval vessels that are designed to catch aircraft and helicopters weighing five metric tons or more.", "Currently scheduled to liftoff around 4:12 p.m. EST May 10 from SpaceX\u2019s LC-39A Florida launch pad, the company\u2019s next mission will send Bangladesh\u2019s first communications satellite \u2013 Bangabandhu-1 \u2013 to a geostationary transfer orbit.

A is a full-scale, uncompromised telescope with an unfathomably vast 15-meter primary mirror and a sunshade with an area anywhere from 5000 to 20000 square meters (1-4 acres). B is a comparatively watered-down take on the broadband surveyor telescope, with a much smaller 8-meter primary mirror, likely accompanied by a similarly reduced sunshade (and price tag, presumably).", "Remember, this is a\u00a0", "space telescope", " that would need to fit into the payload fairing of a rocket, survive the launch into orbit, and then journey nearly one million miles from Earth to its final operational destination, all before deploying a mirror and starshade as large or larger than\u00a0Mr Steven\u2019s SpaceX\u00a0 fairing recovery net. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a rough successor to Hubble with a 6.5-meter primary mirror, is the only space telescope even remotely comparable to LUVOIR, and it has yet to launch after suffering a full decade of delays and almost inconceivable budget overruns. All we can do is hope that Northrop Grumman (primary contractor for JWST) is kept away from future giant space telescopes like LUVOIR.", "Nevertheless, the sheer scale of LUVOIR brings us back to an existential problem faced by all space telescopes \u2013 how to get into space in the first place. In this case, JWST offers a small taste of what launching such a large telescope requires, although it only truly applies the 8m LUVOIR B. The reason LUVOIR\u2019s conceptual design was split into two sizes is specifically tied to the question of launch, with LUVOIR B\u2019s 8m size cap dictated by the ~5 meter-diameter payload fairings prevalent and readily available in today\u2019s launch industry.", "LUVOIR A\u2019s 15-meter mirror, however, would require an equally massive payload fairing. At least at the start, LUVOIR A was conceptualized with NASA\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS) Block 2 as the launch vehicle, a similarly conceptual vehicle baselined with a truly massive 8.4 or 10-meter diameter payload fairing, much larger than anything flown to this day. However, the utterly unimpressive schedule performance of the SLS\u00a0", "Block 1", " development \u2013 let alone Block 1B or 2 \u2013 has undoubtedly sown more than a little doubt over the expectation of its availability for launching LUVOIR and other huge spacecraft.

Delta Heavy\u2019s August 12th mission saw the rocket send a small NASA payload known as Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on a trajectory that will eventually place the craft closer to the Sun than any human-made object before it. In pursuit of a better understanding of how exactly our solar system\u2019s namesake functions and behaves, PSP will also become the fastest object ever created by humans, traveling at an extraordinary 200 km/s (120 mi/s) at the zenith of its deepest periapses (the point at which PSP is closest to the sun).", "In a fitting send-off for the small heat-shielded spacecraft, Delta IV Heavy\u2019s launch was a spectacle to behold, with clear skies and the cover of darkness combining to magnify the best of the rocket\u2019s telltale features. Upon ignition of its three massive RS-68 rocket engines, each producing over 700,000 lb-ft of thrust, the rocket is held down for several seconds in a process that famously culminates in what appears to be self-immolation just before liftoff, a consequence of the rocket burning off excess hydrogen fuel expelled during the ignition process. Unlike Falcon 9\u2019s dirtier kerosene-oxygen combustion, Delta Heavy\u2019s hydrogen and oxygen fuel produce a flame that is nearly transparent, aside from a bright orange tint created by materials in each engine\u2019s ablative (read: designed to disintegrate)\u00a0nozzle.", "While Delta IV Heavy has used one of its other nine successful launches for a NASA payload (a test flight of the Orion capsule), all seven remaining missions were conducted for the USAF (1) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO; 6), and all six remaining missions on the rocket\u2019s manifest also happen to be for the NRO. Put simply, Delta IV Heavy would not exist today if the NRO did not have an explicit and unflappable need for the capabilities it offers. The primary downside is cost: DIVH costs at least $350 million and usually more than $400m per launch. Thankfully for ULA, the NRO has very few problems with money, and the agency\u2019s estimated annual budget of $10 billion (2013) is more than half of NASA\u2019s entire budget.", "After Falcon Heavy\u2019s successful debut, Delta IV Heavy\u2019s monopoly over heavyweight NRO and USAF payloads is rapidly coming to an end, and both agencies are almost certainly attempting to equally quickly certify SpaceX\u2019s newest rocket for critical national security space (NSS) launches.

HTV-X is primarily being designed with an ISS-resupply role still at the forefront, but Russianspaceweb recently reported that JAXA is seriously considering the development of a variant of the robotic spacecraft dedicated to resupplying the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOPG; and I truly wish I were joking about both the name and acronym).", "As the name suggests, LOPG is fundamentally a shrunken, upgraded copy of the present-day International Space Station but with its low Earth orbit swapped for an orbit around the Moon. Why, you might ask? It happens that that question is far less sorted at this point than \u201chow\u201d, and there\u2019s a fairly strong argument to be made that NASA is simply attempting to create a low-hanging-fruit destination for the chronically delayed SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft it routinely spends ~20% of its annual budget on. The alternatives to such a crewed orbital outpost are actually landing on the Moon and building a base or dramatically ramping development of foundations needed to enable the first human missions to Mars.", "Regardless of the LOPG\u2019s existential merits, a lot of energy (and money) is currently being funneled into planning and initial hardware development for the lunar station\u2019s various modular segments. JAXA is currently analyzing ways to resupply LOPG and its crew complement with its HTV-X cargo spacecraft, currently targeting its first annual ISS resupply mission by the end of 2021. While JAXA will use its own domestic H-III rocket to launch HTV-X to the ISS, that rocket simply is not powerful enough to place a minimum of ~10,000 kg (22,000 lb) on a trans-lunar insertion (TLI) trajectory. As such, JAXA is examining SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy as a prime (and affordable) option: by recovering both side boosters on SpaceX\u2019s drone ships and sacrificing the rocket\u2019s center core, a 2/3rds-reusable Falcon Heavy should be able to send as much as 20,000 kg to TLI (lunar orbit), according to comments made by CEO Elon Musk.", "That impressive performance would also be needed for ", "another LOPG payload", ", this time for ESA\u2019s 5-6 ton\u00a0", "European System Providing Refueling Infrastructure and Telecommunications", "\u00a0(ESPRIT) lunar station module.

In order to avoid overheating, Crew Dragon thus needs to bring along its own means of cooling in the form of onboard radiators to shed excess heat. The use of white paint on spacecraft further aids this process by selectively preventing the absorption of solar radiation while simultaneously efficiently emitting in infrared wavelengths.", "Crew Dragon\u2019s primary radiators are elegantly integrated into vertical panels installed on the cylindrical bottom segment, known as the trunk, while the craft\u2019s power source \u2013 solar panels in this case \u2013 are installed in a curved array on the opposite side of the trunk. Intriguingly, the trunks displayed in the two most recent photos of the DM-1 Crew Dragon appear to be almost completely different, and the trunk at Plum Brook does not appear to have its solar arrays or radiators installed. Nominally, SpaceX would use the thermal vacuum capabilities of the Ohio facility to fully vet Crew Dragon\u2019s ability to maintain optimal temperatures on orbit, but the particularly tests planned for the DM-1 capsule and trunk may be of a slightly different type.", "Regardless, after testing at Plum Brook is completed, ", "the DM-1 Crew Dragon capsule", " will be shipped to a newly-constructed processing facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida, while it\u2019s understood that the trunk installed in SpaceX\u2019s June 20th photo will be returned to the Hawthorne, CA factory to be outfitted with flight hardware (presumably including cameras, radiators, solar arrays, and a healthy amount of insulation).

Reminiscent of SpaceX\u2019s late-2016, early-2017 struggles with finding enough space to store their massive flight-proven Falcon 9 boosters, these fairing halves are unable to be reused as a consequence of too much saltwater exposure, making it significantly easier for the company to effectively find any old plot of SpaceX land on which to store them.", "Officially in early 2018, SpaceX is leasing Berth 240 with the explicit intent of constructing a dedicated facility for production of their first Mars rocket prototypes, as well as the relocation of Falcon 9 and Dragon recovery ops, which are quite space-constrained at their current berths. By all appearances, contractor Buntich is staging equipment ahead of initial demolition, refurbishment, and construction operations at Berth 240. Known predominately for pipeline and utility construction and refurbishment, it\u2019s likely that the contractor is in the very early stages of modernizing the decades-abandoned shipyard, particularly, utilities like water, gas, electricity, and more.", "It may be fairly clear why SpaceX is storing four massive, unwieldy, and unreusable Falcon 9 fairing halves at Berth 240, but it\u2019s much less clear what exactly their fates will be.

These halves could be used for drop testing to perfect fairing recovery accuracy and ensure, at long last, that recovery vessel and claw-boat Mr Steven can catch them out of the air, avoiding the vast majority of exposure to seawater. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently noted that ", "Mr Steven\u2019s net would apparently be massively expanded", ", quadrupling its area to relieve some of the burdens of precision currently placed almost entirely on each payload fairing\u2019s navigational capabilities.", "Whether drop testing will actually be conducted is thus unclear, as a decision to expand Mr Steven\u2019s net at least partially indicates that SpaceX engineers are less confident in the each half\u2019s ability to reduce their margins of error by approximately 50%. A quadrupling of usable area implies that Mr Steven\u2019s net will most likely be stretched twofold length-wise and width-wise, or perhaps by 50% for the width and 150% for the length to avoid a need for either an elaborate arm retraction mechanism or a comically unwieldy net.", "Either way, Mr Steven\u2019s next fairing catch attempt is unlikely to occur until the Falcon 9 Block 5 launch of Iridium-7, currently no earlier than mid-July. This gives recovery engineers and technicians at least five weeks to refine fairing accuracy and expand Mr Steven\u2019s net, and Pauline will undoubtedly be there to capture any significant developments aboard the eclectic vessel as both it and drone ship Just Read The Instructions prepare for a return to action."]},

While it\u2019s possible that the mission was a failure, at the moment unsteadily blamed on the failure of a Northrop Grumman-designed payload adapter and deployment mechanism, it\u2019s far more probable that the apparently wildly-expensive satellite is still in orbit.", "Regardless, the same SpaceX rocket booster responsible for lifting Zuma and the Falcon 9 upper stage out of the atmosphere is now ready to launch a new payload at SLC-4E, a launch pad stationed in Vandenberg Air Force Base. B1043\u2019s second orbit-destined payload is a compliment of seven satellites: five are of the Iridium NEXT variety and the remaining satellites make up a scientific mission and technology demonstrator known as GRACE-FO (FO for Follow-On).", "Following in the footsteps of the original GRACE\u2019s (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) 15 year orbital tenure, GRACE-FO is effectively the same mission with significantly upgraded hardware \u2013 the biggest experimental component is actually an advanced laser interferometer designed to measure the distance between the two satellites (roughly equivalent to the distance between LA and San Diego) with the precision of a single micrometer (10-100x smaller than the width of a human hair). At that level of precision, the pair of satellites can detect minute changes in Earth\u2019s gravity, to the extent that they can actually observe droughts, floods, and ice melt through the change in gravity caused by the movement of large (i.e. heavy) quantities of water. If the experimental laser ranging technology works as intended, it will be at least ten times more accurate than the microwave-ranging technology also installed on the follow-on satellites.", "On the SpaceX side of things, Falcon 9 B1043 will be expended after dutifully completing the launch of Iridium-6/GRACE-FO, although the presence of grid fins on the rocket indicates that SpaceX will likely continue a regime of soft-landing recovery tests to optimize and flesh out the limits of Falcon 9\u2019s capabilities. At first glance, the tradeoff of expending entire rocket boosters able to be\u00a0(relatively inefficiently) refurbished for considerably more than two flights seems extreme and inadvisable.

At that level of reusability, expending Falcon 9 Block 5s would\u00a0truly become comparable with the absurdity of trashing an airliner after one or a handful of flights, an (in)famous talking point used by Elon Musk over his years of public SpaceX discussions.", "Thus, if SpaceX can gather data that might enable ", "future Falcon 9 Block 5 recoveries", " by expending ", "much\u00a0", "less valuable Block 3 and 4 boosters, the payoff would be irresistible once examined with a long-term outlook. In the sense that Block 5 may be capable of magnitudes more flights with considerably cheaper refurbishment, the literal elemental value of the hardware \u2013 in the likely event that Block 5 production is more capital-intensive than Block 3/4 \u2013 is more or less irrelevant for an aversion to expending Block 5 boosters.", "Rather, what is lost alongside an expendable Block 5 mission is instead the comparatively vast amount of revenue locked within dozens of additional highly-profitable launches each expended booster could have supported. From that perspective, expending Block 3s and 4s to gather data might be accurately compared to destroying single-pilot Cessnas to improve the utility of a 747 airliner.", "After B1043 is expended, only three obvious flightworthy cores will remain outside of the gradually growing Falcon 9 Block 5 fleet (just two boosters, currently). In order of anticipated launch, these three missions are SES-12 (NET May 31), CRS-15 (NET June 28), and the Crew Dragon in-flight abort test (NET Q4 2018).

While he did not go into detail, it\u2019s probable that SpaceX\u2019s inability to reuse ocean-retrieved fairings derives from the extremely clean environments satellites are designed to survive in. Before reaching the vacuum of space, arguably the \u2018cleanest\u2019 environment that exists, satellite payloads (be it cameras, antennae, solar panels, can be generalized as extraordinarily sensitive collections of electronics and sensors that remain in clean-room environments throughout their time on Earth.

Mr Steven\u2019s massive steel arms appear to be fairly permanent in their current forms, suggesting that changing the aspect ratio of the net would be far more effort than simply expanding his arms along their current paths. Either way, lengthwise growth of a factor of 2-2.5 would appear to functionally close the gap on that 0.005% margin of error (the current 0.01% \u2013 missing by 50 meters \u2013 divided by 2 equals 0.005%) required, albeit by modifying the recovery vessel instead of optimizing the fairings\u2019 hardware and software.", "Put more simply, a net with four times the area would roughly halve the accuracy required from each fairing half for reliable recovery.

Put simply, SpaceX now intends to build every single major component of its 4400+ satellite network in-house. It\u2019s almost easier to list the things SpaceX does not mean to build themselves, but here\u2019s a stab at the components to be built in-house: satellite structures, laser (optical) data interlinks, on-orbit phased array antennae,\u00a0digital signal processor (DSPs) software and hardware to aim those antennae, solar arrays, battery systems, power electronics, custom integrated circuitry and systems on a chip (SoCs), user terminals and larger gateways, network operations, production automation, autonomous satellite constellation management, and much, much more.", "While entire articles could be spent describing the complexities of every single one of the above subsystems, the point is that SpaceX appears to have gone all-in on building its own satellite constellation, departing from stances in the past that appeared to leave room for subcontracting and outsourcing the production of major parts of the network, particularly with respect to ground terminals and gateways. Postings for ground station and user terminal engineers describe a goal of medium to high volume in-house production of the critical network and customer-facing hardware, and an entry into the production of high volume consumer technology would be a truly eclectic and unprecedented step for a company theoretically focused on launch vehicle development and production and sustainable Mars colonization.", "If anything, they speak to the truly vertical nature of SpaceX. Many technology development production companies would simply accede and accept the best subcontractor/outsourcing bid when entering into new territory truly outside of their internal expertise. SpaceX engineers and managers, however, seem to have concluded that the vast majority of hardware and corporate expertise they ", "could", " co-opt is just not satisfactory for the purpose of building a paradigm-shifting satellite constellation; or as CEO Elon Musk ", "noted in 2015", ", to \u201crevolutionize the satellite side of things, just as we\u2019ve done with the rocket side of things.\u201d", "This new (and, in retrospect, unsurprising) trailblazing attitude also helps to explain the marginal delay to Musk\u2019s original 2015 schedule, which estimated initial constellation operations (i.e. a few hundred satellites launched) would begin around 2020. Approximately a year later, SpaceX had built rough prototypes in the form of the original Microsat 1A and 1B twins. This initial foray into independent, long-term communications smallsats was shuttered fairly quickly, and neither of the demo satellites were launched. Instead, SpaceX dove back into prototype design and development, culminating roughly two years later with the March 2018 launch of two dramatically improved prototypes, known as Tintin A and B (or Microsats 2A and 2B in FCC licenses).", "It seems probable that the source of this delay lay in an internal decision to dramatically reconfigure the internet constellation for far more in-house development, whereas the original Microsats were likely pieced together from a range of components derived from SpaceX\u2019s Cargo Dragon program or more simply from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) offerings. Instead, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink development offices in Redmond, Washington and throughout California are staffed with as many as 400 to 500 employees dedicated in large part to the nascent program, similar (if not larger) in scale to OneWeb, the only noteworthy satellite internet competitor at present.", "If SpaceX\u2019s decision to push back Starlink\u2019s operational debut by a few years in order to bring in-house almost every single critical subcomponent of Starlink pays off, the company could begin launching finalized satellites en masse as early as late 2019/early 2020, with a goal of offering limited service by 2021 per comments made by CEO Elon Musk. Starlink is likely being brought almost entirely in-house because Musk or other high-level executives and engineers see major room for improvement, improvements that could lower the cost of and improve the performance of lightweight communications satellites by an order of magnitude.", "It will likely take a bit longer than initially expected, but SpaceX may yet still pave their path to Mars colonization with profits derived from a wildly successful and disruptive entrance into the broadband market."]},

Without hesitation, otherwise reputable outlets like CNBC and the Wall Street Journal immediately published separate articles claiming that lawmakers had been updated about the mission and told that the satellite had been destroyed while reentering Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Having completely failed to both make it to orbit and \u201cperfectly\u201d separate from SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 second stage, these articles implicitly placed the blame on SpaceX.", "Claims of Zuma\u2019s failure to properly separate from the second stage of the rocket led immediately to suggestions that SpaceX was at fault. The satellite\u2019s manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, also refused to comment due to the classified nature of the mission, and the company may well have had their hands tied by requirements of secrecy from their customer(s). Immediately following these quick revelations, SpaceX was understandably bombarded with requests for comment by the media and furnished a response that further acknowledged the off-limits secrecy of the mission. However, SpaceX also stated that the company\u2019s available data ", "showed that Falcon 9 completed the mission without fault", ".", "Without any background knowledge of spaceflight, this flurry of reporting and corporate comments would seem to be perfectly reasonable and unsurprising. However, the barest application of simple logic and orbital mechanics (what is actually involved in launching satellites to orbit) would have almost completely invalidated the information purportedly given to them.", "Around the same time as claims of complete failure and satellite reentry were published, amateur spy satellite trackers had already begun the routine task of tracking and cataloging Zuma\u2019s launch and orbit. Following ", "Ars Technica\u2019s", " breaking (and thankfully even-keeled) article on whispers of failure, reputable journalist ", "Peter B. de Selding corroborated the rumors", " with reports that Zuma could be dead in orbit after separation from SpaceX\u2019s upper stage. These facts alone ought to have stopped dead any speculation that Zuma had reentered while still attached to the Falcon 9 upper stage, and this was strengthened further by Dr. Marco Langbroek, who later published images provided to him that with very little doubt showed the second stage in a relatively stable orbit similar to the orbit that might be expected after a nominal launch.", "Further complicating claims that the satellite failed to separate, Northrop Grumman ", "had explicitly required", " that they be allowed to furnish the payload adapter for the Zuma mission, meaning that SpaceX was not responsible for connecting the satellite to the second stage, nor separating it after launch. In other words, if the satellite failed to separate, it would appear that SpaceX could not be easily blamed. However, regardless of these facts, SpaceX\u2019s COO Gwynne Shotwell issued a thoroughly blunt and explicit statement earlier this morning, January 9. In no simple terms, she pegged rumors implicating SpaceX as the source of failure as \u201ccategorically false.\u201d More importantly, she reiterated the simple facts that ", "Falcon Heavy\u2019s static fire and launch campaign were proceeding apace", ", and further stated that an upcoming launch of a communications satellite for SES and the Luxembourg government was also proceeding nominally for a launch around the end of January.", "Quite simply, if SpaceX\u2019s hardware had suffered ", "any", " form of anomaly, let alone issues serious enough to destroy a customer\u2019s payload, all future launches would be immediately and indefinitely postponed, and all customers would be simultaneously notified of Falcon 9\u2019s grounding. The last thing that a launch company would do in such an event is to allow a respected executive blatantly and publicly lie to the media about a long-time customer\u2019s imminent launch date. For satellite communications companies like SES, delayed launches can cause major problems for shareholders and throw a multitude of wrenches into the fiscal gears, as delayed launches cost money on their own. They also delay the point at which any given satellite can begin to generate revenue.", "While current information almost unequivocally suggests that SpaceX is in the clear, there has yet to be any official confirmation that the Zuma satellite is in any way dead or has actually failed. This is par for the course of classified government launches, and Zuma\u2019s launch campaign was even more secretive and eccentric than usual \u2013 we still have no idea what government agency or agencies are responsible for the mission. And the satellite\u2019s manufacturer was explicitly provided only a few minutes before its launch. Any publication with experience dealing with military topics and news would explicitly understand that any \u2018leaked\u2019 information on highly classified topics is inherently untrustworthy and ought to be handled with the utmost rigor and skepticism.", "In reality, the most we will ever likely know about these mysterious events will be provided in a handful of weeks by amateur satellite trackers: if they find a new object motionless in the expected orbit, leaks of Zuma\u2019s abject failure will be largely corroborated. If nothing appears in that orbit once the satellite is expected to be visible, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuma reentered the atmosphere at some point, also hinting at a total failure. It can be said with some certainty that if Zuma failed to detach from Falcon 9\u2019s second stage, SpaceX would delay its planned reentry indefinitely until all conceivable attempts to salvage the mission had been analyzed. Observations from pilots and people on the ground suggest without a doubt that the second stage reached a stable orbit, and once in that orbit, reentry could be delayed for weeks or months if the stage was not intentionally deorbited. Dr. Langbroek ", "discusses these possibilities", " in greater detail in an article posted to his blog.", "Ultimately, there are still numerous odd aspects surrounding the launch of Zuma that do not wholly mesh with publicly available information. For example, initial reports about the launch made it clear that the customer had explicitly contracted Zuma\u2019s launch for no later or earlier than November 2017. This was delayed until January after SpaceX reportedly discovered issues with at least one Falcon 9 payload fairing, although the launch of Iridium-4 just over a month later was not delayed, and a replacement fairing was never spotted at Cape Canaveral (not that unusual). Why November 2017, and why delay the launch for nearly two months after that window was missed?", "\u00a0", "Of note, anonymous comments on Reddit were also corroborated by Eric Berger of Ars Technica, suggesting that Elon Musk did actually tell SpaceX employees that the launch of ", "Zuma was possibly the most expensive and/or important contract SpaceX had yet to win.", " This raises a huge number of questions, as the payload was clearly small enough for Falcon 9 to return to Landing Zone-1 for recovery. This caps the mass of Zuma at about that of SpaceX\u2019s Cargo Dragon spacecraft, indeed a fairly hefty capsule at around 10,000 kg, but still far from a satisfying explanation of its apparent value. While it seems unlikely that Zuma alone cost $1 billion or more, as many outlets have been suggesting (assuming?), it might be more reasonable to assume that the potential value of Zuma comes from future missions it might act as a proof of concept for \u2013 a highly secretive defense-related satellite constellation, in other words. This, too, slips uncomfortably far into the realm of \u201ccrazy government conspiracy theories,\u201d but other explanations are far not forthcoming.", "Sadly, the secrecy surrounding Zuma means that the general public will almost certainly remain in the dark for the indefinite future, at least until some future administration chooses to declassify it. The question of whether Zuma failed and whether that failure can be attributed to Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, or some combination of the two will nevertheless be answered imminently by delays or the lack-thereof for SpaceX\u2019s upcoming launch manifest of Falcon Heavy, GovSat-1/SES-16, and PAZ, all scheduled within the next four weeks, give or take."]},

According to Orlando\u2019s News 13, the attempt was scrubbed only after one of eight hold-down clamps showed signs of bugs.", "While Falcon Heavy is not explicitly critical for SpaceX\u2019s near-term launch business and its loftier future goals, the development and operation of such a massive launch vehicle will likely serve as a strong foundation as the company transitions more aggressively into the design, engineering, and manufacture of its still-larger BFR series of rocket boosters and upper stages. Falcon Heavy stands approximately as tall as Falcon 9 at around 70 m (230 ft), but features three times the thrust and a little less than three times the weight of SpaceX\u2019s workhorse rocket. With 27 Merlin 1D engines to Falcon 9\u2019s namesake nine, Falcon Heavy\u2019s 22,800 kN (5,000,000 lbf) of thrust is a nearly inconceivably amount of power, equivalent to\u00a0", "twenty", " Airbus A380 passenger jets at full throttle.", "If SpaceX manages to pull off Falcon Heavy as a successful and reliable launch vehicle on the order of its reasonably successful Falcon 9, BFR may well be an easier vehicle to develop and operate, thanks to its single-core design. As Musk himself has discussed over the last year or so, the problem of safely and reliably distributing the thrust of Heavy\u2019s side cores to the center core was unexpectedly difficult, as were the issues of igniting all 27 Merlin 1Ds and safely separating the side cores while in flight. Ultimately, the payload improvement (while in a fully reusable mode of operation) was quite small, particularly for the geostationary missions that make up essentially all prospective Falcon Heavy customer missions.", "The additional complexity of recovery and refurbishing three separate Falcon 9 boosters almost simultaneously likely serves to only worsen the vehicle\u2019s potential payoff, although the upcoming Block 5 iteration of Falcon 9 may partially improve the vehicle\u2019s ease of operation. If Block 5 is indeed as reusable as SpaceX intends to make it, then a handful of Block 5 Falcon Heavy vehicles could presumably maintain a decent launch cadence for the vehicle without requiring costly and time-consuming shipping all over the continental US.", "Nevertheless, the (hopefully successful) experience that will follow the launch and recovery operation of a super heavy-lift launch vehicle (SHLV) with ~30 first stage engines will be invaluable for SpaceX\u2019s interplanetary goals. While BFR will be free of the complexity Falcon Heavy\u2019s triple-core first stage added, it is still a massive vehicle that absolutely dwarfs anything SpaceX has attempted before. BFR in its 2017 iteration would mass around three times that of Falcon Heavy and feature 30 Raptor engines capable of approximately 53,000 kN (12,000,000 lbf) of thrust at liftoff, around 2.5x that of Heavy. Many, many other features mean that BFR and particularly BFS will be extraordinarily difficult to realize: BFS alone will be treading into truly unprecedented areas of spaceflight with the scale, longevity, and reusability it is intended to achieve while comfortably ferrying dozens of astronauts to and from Mars and the Moon.", "However, the scale of BFR is equivalent to that of the famous Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. In other words, while still dumbfoundingly massive and unprecedented in the modern era, rockets at the scale of BFR do in fact have a precedent of success, which lends the effort considerable plausibility, at least at proof-of-concept level. As of September 2017, Elon Musk suggested that SpaceX was aiming to begin construction of the first BFS (Big ____ Spaceship) by the end of Q2 2018, a truly Muskian deadline that probably wont hold. Still, if construction of the first prototype begins at any point in 2018, it will bode well for SpaceX\u2019s aggressive timelines.", "In the meantime, BFR\u2019s precursor Falcon Heavy has effectively completed its first wet dress rehearsal, although the static fire attempt was scrubbed for the day. This is understandable for such a complex and untested vehicle, especially after SpaceX\u2019s exceptionally quick modifications to Pad 39A. While unofficial, word is that an issue with one of the Transport/Erector/Launcher\u2019s (TEL) eight separate launch clamps caused the scrub. Those launch clamps ensure that the massive vehicle would stay put during a static fire, and the status of those clamps would be especially important during such an unusually long static fire of such a powerful rocket.", "Stay tuned for updates on SpaceX\u2019s upcoming launches and Falcon Heavy\u2019s next static fire attempt, likely within the next several days. The vehicle\u2019s inaugural launch date is effectively up in the air until the static fire has been successfully completed, but as of yesterday SpaceX was understood to be targeting January 26th.

At this point in time, based on comments from Shotwell and CEO Elon Musk, it can be reasonably assumed that SpaceX\u2019s Texas launch facilities will be dedicated mainly to the company\u2019s interplanetary colonization efforts, and will probably be tailored to support the testing and eventual launches of BFR/BFS.", "After nine months of earnest construction and rehabilitation, SpaceX\u2019s LC-40 pad was recently reactivated and has since supported two launches without any major hitches.

With both of those major tasks now effectively complete, SpaceX\u2019s pad construction team is free to either refocus their efforts towards Boca Chica. Over the past several months, Boca Chica has seen a gradual but consistent level of development, mainly by way of unaffiliated SpaceX contractors. These changes have been dutifully tracked over the last several years on ", "NASASpaceflight.com forums", " by a handful of friendly local residents interested in the changes coming to Boca Chica and Brownsville, Texas, a nearby town.", "Most significantly, the last several months have seen ", "three major developments", ".

The ", "STARGATE facility", " is a public-private partnership between the University of Texas at Brownsville (now part of\u00a0", "University of Texas Rio Grande Valley", ") and SpaceX, with the academic components focusing on research that SpaceX undoubtedly has interest in: improved orbital spacecraft tracking and communications. Operationally, SpaceX will use the facilities to communicate with and operate its Crew Dragon spacecraft during launches, set to begin with an uncrewed demonstration mission ", "as early as August 2018.", "Second", ", an absolutely massive trolley crane appeared on SpaceX\u2019s land and was eventually housed in an apparently purpose-built shed. The crane dwarfs anything currently used at SpaceX\u2019s launch facilities and is almost certainly a custom-ordered piece of equipment, and thus would be both expensive and explicitly purposeful. What that purpose might be is currently unknown, but it is entirely plausible that the crane is intended to support initial testing (or even limited manufacturing) of SpaceX\u2019s first BFS prototype rockets. This speculation has now been strengthened by Shotwell\u2019s January 11 2018 comment on potential \u201cvehicle tests\u201d occurring at the site within a year or so, and also meshes with a presentation she gave in October 2017 at MIT.

A handful of months later, NASASpaceflight user and all-around awesome guy Nomadd has installed a webcam on a tall pole with a wonderful view of both the solar installation (now nearly completed) and STARGATE. The acre of solar panels can be expected to produce as much as half a megawatt (MW) at peak sun, likely more than enough to offset a considerable amount of the facilities\u2019 electricity usage even after it begins to be see serious use.", "\u00a0", "Originally announced as an additional Falcon launch facility in 2014", ", Boca Chica has remained relatively dormant over the last three years, and it is truly exciting to see activity ramping up.

Still, that is a small ask for for Brownsville\u2019s local government and Texas as a whole, both of which have clearly enjoyed and begun to benefit from SpaceX\u2019s presence in the otherwise unknown area. SpaceX is unlikely to give up on Boca Chica in the near term, so long as Ms. Shotwell maintains her belief that it is effectively the perfect location for BFR launches.", "Overall, Shotwell\u2019s comments over the last several months and today in particular are increasingly encouraging, and things are likely to only speed up as 2018 progresses, allowing SpaceX to focus more and more of its expertise on BFR, BFS, and its South Texas testing and launch facilities.", "Full disclosure: As Shotwell did not specify which vehicle or vehicles could be expected to begin testing in 2018/2019, it is possible that Falcon 9, not BFR, was the statement\u2019s target.

It was noted earlier this morning by spaceflight journalist Chris Bergin that things were ", "\u201ca bit too quiet\u201d", " if a test was indeed planned for today, ", "and his intuition appears to have been correct", ". It still remains the case that Falcon Heavy is an experimental and untested rocket to an extent, and these delays are to be expected as SpaceX works out the inevitable kinks and bugs that arise during the extensive testing big launch vehicle has been and is still being put through.", "Due to range requirements in support of an upcoming launch of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s (ULA) Atlas 5 rocket, currently NET Thursday, SpaceX has postponed the static fire of Falcon Heavy without a replacement date. It is unlikely that another attempt will occur ", "before the upcoming weekend", ", but SpaceX should have at least a solid week of uninterrupted range support once ULA\u2019s launch occurs, hopefully without delay. Godspeed to ULA, in the meantime.", "Most recently, and perhaps somewhat related to Falcon Heavy\u2019s static fire delays, ", "SpaceX completed as many as two complete wet dress rehearsals (WDRs),", " which saw Falcon Heavy topped off with full tanks of its cryogenic (super cool) liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade jet fuel (RP-1). In essence, the rocket became equivalent to several hundred ", "tons", " of carefully stabilized explosive. Nominally, these rehearsals appear entirely uneventful to an outside observer, with little more than ice formation and the occasional bursts of propellant tank vents to suggest that something important is occurring. However, anomalies like the failure of Falcon 9 during the Amos-6 static fire provide a staggering demonstration of just how explosive and sensitive a rocket\u2019s fuel is, and Falcon Heavy has approximately three times the fuel capacity of Falcon 9. Empty, Falcon 9\u2019s mass ", "has been estimated to be around 30 metric tons", ", a minuscule amount of structure in the face of the more than 500 metric tons of propellant the vehicle carries at liftoff.", "These propellant loading tests can also be challenging for reasons aside from their highly explosive nature. Due to basic realities of the physical nature of metal, the predominate ingredient for Falcon 9\u2019s load-bearing structures, metallic structures shrink under extreme cold (and expand under heating). In the case of Falcon 9\u2019s massive 45 meters (150 foot) tall first stage, the scale of this contraction can be on the order of several inches or more, particularly given SpaceX\u2019s predilection towards cooling their propellant as much as possible to increase its energy density. For Falcon 9, these issues (thermodynamic loads) are less severe. However, add in three relatively different first stage boosters linked together with several extremely strong supports at both their tops and bottoms and that dynamic loading can become a fickle beast. The expansion or compression of materials due to temperature changes can create absolutely astounding amounts of pressure \u2013 if you\u2019ve ever forgotten a glass bottled drink in the freezer and discovered it violently exploded at some future point, you\u2019ll have experienced this yourself.", "With several inches of freedom and the possibility that each Falcon Heavy booster might contract or expand slightly differently, these forces could understandably wreak havoc with the high precision necessary for the huge rocket to properly connect with the launch pad\u2019s ground systems that transmit propellant, fluids, and telemetry back and forth. Information from two reliable Kennedy Space Center sources experienced with the reality of operating rockets, ", "as well as NASASpaceflight.com", ", suggested that issues with dynamic loads (such as those created by thermal contraction/expansion) are a likely explanation for the delays, further evidenced by their observations that much of the pad crew\u2019s attention appeared to be focused at the base of Transporter/Erector/Launcher (TEL). The TEL base hosts the clamps that hold the rocket down during static fires and launches, as well as the Tail Service Masts (TSMs) that connect with the Falcon 9/Heavy to transport propellant and data to the first stage(s). These connection points are both relatively tiny, mechanically sensitive, and absolutely critical for the successful operation of the rocket, and thus are a logical point of failure in the event of off-nominal or unpredicted levels of dynamic stresses.", "All things considered, these difficulties demonstrate that even after months (even years) of relentless modeling, testing, remodeling, and retesting, rockets (and especially huge rockets like Falcon Heavy) are immensely complex, and even tiny mistakes can lead the vehicle to stray from its expected behavior. Quite simply, the reality of engineering only truly comes into play once hardware is fully in the loop, and it\u2019s in this state that SpaceX has demonstrated again and again a distinct and elegant ability to learn from their hardware, rather than attempt to salve uncertainty with a neurotic and counterproductive level of statistical analysis, modelling, and documentation. The agile launch company still dabbles in those aspects when beneficial or necessary, but testing comes first in its importance.", "The conclusion here, then, is that Falcon Heavy\u2019s delays betray this aspect of SpaceX \u2013 a launch company that loves its fans, but also understands the need for cautious testing when it comes to new and untried rocket hardware.

For a typical launch of Falcon 9, the rocket and payload will normally arrive at the given launch pad around a month or so before the anticipated launch date. Next, the satellite payload is encapsulated inside Falcon 9\u2019s payload fairing, typically two or so weeks before launch. Pad facilities would be thoroughly examined after the previous launch to remedy any wear and tear and ensure that it is in good working order ahead of the next mission. Approximately a week before launch, Falcon 9\u2019s first and second stages are mated together inside the pad\u2019s integration facilities, the pad\u2019s Transport/Erector/Launcher (TEL) is rolled into the integration facilities, and the Falcon 9 booster and second stage (sans payload) are mounted onto the TEL. Finally, the TEL and rocket are rolled out to the launch pad for a brief 3-5 second static fire around 5-7 days before launch. After testing is completed, the TEL is rolled back to the integration facilities, the payload fairing and payload are attached to the rocket, and the whole stack is once more rolled back to the pad, ready for launch.", "For a used booster, this is the sum total of the prelaunch procedures it will go through at the pad, after recovery and refurbishment. For all new boosters, however, SpaceX currently conducts a thorough slate of tests for all Merlin 1D and MVac (2nd stage) rocket engines, as well as both the integrated first and second stages at its McGregor, Texas facilities. These tests last far longer than those conducted at the launch pad, and typically run for the full length of a launch in order to better simulate the stresses flight hardware will end up experiencing. In other words, new Falcon 9 hardware ", "always", " has to make it through hundreds of seconds of live firing and post-test analysis before finally being shipped to SpaceX\u2019s launch facilities, where it conducts the aforementioned brief static fire at the pad.", "To put it simply, Falcon Heavy is a whole different animal when it comes to prelaunch testing. Due to the rocket\u2019s sheer size and power in its fully integrated state, McGregor simply does not have the capability to conduct the same tests it does with Falcon 9. While two of the first Heavy\u2019s three first stage boosters are modified flight-proven Falcon 9s (from Thaicom-8 and CRS-9), ", "the center core required a far more extensive suite of changes", " from a normal Falcon 9 in order to survive the added stresses it would experience during a Falcon Heavy launch. Although the full-up vehicle could not be tested in Texas with a full-length firing, each of its three first stages and upper stage went through the same tests as a normal Falcon 9. Before that, both side core and\u00a0center core structural test articles (STA) went through a large amount of mechanical stress testing to verify that Falcon Heavy\u2019s re-engineered design would be able to easily survive the stresses of launch and then some. In short, months and months of work have gone into the hardware that both preceded and makes up the Falcon Heavy rocket currently vertical and weeks from launch at Kennedy Space Center.", "However, SpaceX has learned the hard way that simulation and partial physical testing can only go so far, and cannot be completely trusted when it comes to flying new hardware, as evidenced by the both Falcon 1 and the company\u2019s several first attempts at recovering a Falcon 9 booster (intact, at least\u2026). Even the best and most brilliant engineers and technicians can only do so much without testing the real thing in real conditions, something that can often result in unintended failures \u2013 especially the case with new technologies. Falcon Heavy is indeed a new technology to some extent or at least incorporates numerous new technologies that SpaceX has little to no operational experience with. These and relatively untried aspects include the simultaneous ignition and operation of\u00a0twenty seven\u00a0already powerful Merlin 1D engines, new stresses on the center booster during launch, a unique non-explosive side booster separation mechanism, the also near-simultaneous recovery of three first stages, and a second stage tasked with placing an unusual payload in the highest orbit SpaceX has yet to attempt.", "Hence ", "Elon Musk\u2019s aggressive expectation maintenance", " over the last year or so, in which he spared no punches while imparting upon several audiences the likelihood that Falcon Heavy\u2019s first launch would fail entirely, and maybe even destroy the launch pad. In reality, SpaceX is clearly doing everything in their power to ensure that the massive rocket\u2019s first launch is a total success.", "Recent delays to the vehicle\u2019s first static fire test at SpaceX\u2019s Launch Complex 39A are strong examples of this cautious approach. While fans and outsiders alike may be nipping at the bit for the vehicle\u2019s long-awaited inaugural static fire and launch, SpaceX clearly is laser-focused on\u00a0", "very\u00a0", "thoroughly testing the vehicle and is exerting great caution. After the first static fire attempt was delayed, reportedly due to a buggy launch clamp, SpaceX had nevertheless completed its first (presumably successful) wet dress rehearsal (WDR), which saw the vehicle prepared for launch with a full load of propellant and other miscellaneous fluids. After a brief period back horizontal at the pad, likely to repair whatever fault initially caused the delay, Falcon Heavy has been vertical at the pad for the last several days. Intriguingly, albeit unsurprisingly, ", "tank venting was reported early Sunday by local observers", ". This indicates that SpaceX conducted at least one additional wet dress rehearsal with Falcon Heavy, likely both contributing to ", "an additional delay of the replacement static fire date", " (Monday) and solidifying confidence in the new test date, Tuesday, January 16.", "Compared with the results of the first WDR (a three-day delay), the one day delay that followed Sunday\u2019s rehearsal is great news for what is effectively a mature launch vehicle prototype. SpaceX\u2019s confidence is clearly growing, and while all delays of the static fire will likely push back the launch date at least as much, Falcon Heavy will almost certainly find itself days away from its inaugural liftoff sometime in very late January or February 2018.", "Follow along live as Teslarati\u2019s launch photographer ", "Tom Cross covers Falcon Heavy\u2019s exciting series of events", " while they happen on our ", "Instagram", "."]},

Perhaps most intriguingly, he reiterated SpaceX\u2019s interest in enabling exploration of the Moon and Mars, while also clarifying that the upcoming Falcon 9 upgrade will be the last major change to the vehicle for the indefinite future.", "Although the audience may have been more focused on SpaceX\u2019s potential lunar prospects, Brost provided a vision similar to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s common-knowledge goal of Martian (and interplanetary) colonization. This lunar focus was in part evidenced by a pointed question from an audience member that triggered Brost\u2019s subsequent suggestion ", "that the Moon could be a more logical starting place", " for the company as it ramps up its deep space efforts and gradually slips beyond Earth orbit. This strategic and calculated extension of the aspirations of the launch company\u2019s famous founder is a rational attempt to position SpaceX in ways that allow the company to derive as much value as possible from the US government\u2019s recently revived interest in returning the US and its astronauts to the Moon.", "To a large extent, his comments mesh with the vision Elon Musk reiterated at 2017\u2019s September IAC.", "SpaceX\u2019s next-generation heavy-lift rocket and spaceship (", "BFR and BFS", ") are being designed to carry 150 metric tons into low Earth orbit while still recovering both the first and second stages, and will be purpose-built for rapid and complete reusability. BFR and BFS are also being intentionally designed to be relatively destination-agnostic. In other words, BFS will be capable of transporting cargo and eventually crew to a number of destinations in the solar system, be it the Moon, Mars, or beyond. The outer planets are almost certainly off limits for crew due to the sheer length of any journey beyond the orbit of Mars, but BFR, as it was discussed last year, would be capable of transporting unprecedented amounts of cargo almost anywhere in the solar system. Reusability is, of course, paramount to SpaceX\u2019s operational intent with BFR/BFS; unless a very lucrative offer is made, it is highly unlikely that SpaceX will even consider expendable missions, thus partially limiting what the next-gen vehicle will be capable of.", "Still, it will be an incredibly capable rocket even with full reusability.

A continual stream of upgrades and modifications has been one of the only real constants with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket: the original Falcon 9 is in almost every respect a completely different rocket when compared to the Falcon 9 Full Thrust (FT/1.2) of the present.

While it was undeniably vague and rather less than crystal-clear, it can be interpreted as something like this: once Block 5 has been introduced and begun to fly and refly both regularly and successfully, the vast majority of SpaceX\u2019s launch vehicle development expertise will begin to focus intensely on the development and testing of BFR and BFS.", "Statements from just last week made by SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell strengthen this intuitive leap considerably, because BFR and BFS are liable to require a considerable amount of attention as they proceed through design maturation and eventually begin physical hardware testing in Texas.", "Shotwell\u2019s comments implied that ", "SpaceX\u2019s Boca Chica launch facilities", ", currently under construction, would be ready to support \u201cvehicle tests\u201d as early as late 2018/early 2019. Comments from earlier in 2017 indicate that SpaceX (and Shotwell) perceive Boca Chica as a near-perfect location for BFR launches (and thus BFR testing, as well). Finally, Brost\u2019s implication that SpaceX\u2019s exceptional team of brilliant and innovative launch vehicle engineers would be refocused on BFR soon after Block 5 was stable also meshes with this rough timeline. If Falcon 9 Block 5 does indeed debut within the \u201cnext few months\u201d as Brost stated, it will have likely reached some level of design and operational maturity by the end of 2018, assuming SpaceX\u2019s expected launch cadence.", "\u00a0", "As of right now, ", "SpaceX is already looking at a very busy February", ", and currently has as many as three commercial launches scheduled within a period of maybe three weeks (GovSat-1, PAZ, and Hispasat), maybe even four if Falcon Heavy completes its first static fire later this weekend.

While this has not been communicated by SpaceX, it is a logical conclusion following several recent developments. Namely the true beginning of BFR test article fabrication and an impressively bullish level of commitment and confidence in the fully reusable launch system demonstrated in the last few months alone by CEO Elon Musk and President/COO Gwynne Shotwell. While Musk is infamous both within and beyond his companies for painfully impractical development timelines, he demonstrated some level of growing consciousness of that fallibility at 2018\u2019s SXSW, ", "stating that he was working on recalibrating his expectations", ". Without taking a breath, he reiterated his anticipation for short hop tests of the first full-scale spaceship prototype in the first half of 2019.", "While anyone familiar with Musk\u2019s timeline antics may roll their eyes and laugh, far more shocking was Shotwell\u2019s sudden pivot towards a new sense of optimism for the BFR program. ", "At Satellite Conference 2018", ", the typically reserved and pragmatic executive confirmed beyond any doubt that she had become aggressively bullish on the Mars rocket, stating that she believed the spaceship would be ready for suborbital testing in 2019, while the booster-spaceship system could potentially reach orbit by 2020. Musk and Shotwell\u2019s suggestion that BFR\u2019s first suborbital testing \u2013 akin to an extreme version of SpaceX\u2019s Grasshopper and F9R programs \u2013 is expected to begin in 2019 meshes well with a recent explosion of activity at Port of San Pedro in Los Angeles, CA, thanks to a combination of\u00a0land acquisition, successful bureaucracy-wrangling,\u00a0 and the first hints of construction and BFR production. It\u2019s highly unlikely that SpaceX would have chosen to temporarily move BFR prototyping into a giant tent on abandoned dock space\u00a0rather than waiting for port and city approvals for their permanent port factory if they were not keen on moving full speed ahead with the fully reusable launch vehicle\u2019s development.", "SpaceX\u2019s Director of Real-Estate Bruce McHugh was less confident when he spoke before Port of San Pedro\u2019s board of commissioners on April 19, although all in attendance expressed a huge amount of excitement at the increasingly likely prospects of a ", "huge SpaceX rocket factory materializing", " in their neighborhood. Local contractors, economic development representatives, and many other community members were eager for the approval and permitting process to finish up, after which SpaceX is characteristically likely to begin demolition and construction in earnest at Berth 240, the prospective site for the company\u2019s first dedicated BFR factory.", "Early phases of in-house BFR structures", " prototyping is taking shape behind the flaps of a custom-ordered temporary tent, something like 60m long, 30m wide, and ~15m tall at the highest point \u2013 half an acre of eccentric but functional space for Mars rocket R&D, in other words. The primary benefit of these facilities\u2019 dock-side locations is the minimization of the transportation hell that SpaceX would have had to suffer through to transport 9m-diameter rocket hardware through downtown Los Angeles \u2013 feats that would cost as much as $2.5 million\u00a0", "one way", " each time components had to be moved from the Hawthorne factory to the Port of LA, where it would be finally shipped to Texas or Florida.", "Speaking at a ", "private talk given to MIT campus members in October 2017,", " attendees reported that Shotwell stated that although \u201c[BFR\u2019s] composite tanks [would] be a challenge [for SpaceX],\u201d the company was already working on maturing the technologies required, and also noted that SpaceX was \u201cbuilding a larger [version of] Raptor right now.\u201d Half a year later, outsiders have heard nothing of any additional carbon composite propellant tank testing at the new 9m diameter, but the existence of custom-ordered (i.e. very expensive and specialized) composite fabrication tooling of the same diameter as BFR effectively guarantees that SpaceX has settled upon and is confident in its approach to manufacturing the massive composite tankage and structures. Along with a similar line of thought, expensive tooling with a fixed diameter also indicates \u2013 albeit with less certainty \u2013 that the vehicle\u2019s Raptor propulsion system is not expected to change significantly as BFR marches closer to suborbital and orbital testing. Raptor, in other words, is probably considerably more mature than SpaceX\u2019s composite tankage expertise, itself fairly advanced given the mandrel and additional fabrication tooling already present at Port of San Pedro.", "And yet, Shotwell\u2019s most telling display of confidence occurred just a handful of days ago at the ", "TED2018 conference", ". In a lengthy and fairly well-orchestrated interview with the session\u2019s host Chris Anderson, Shotwell repeatedly and happily made comments indicating that she has become extremely bullish on BFR and BFS in the last several months.\u00a0In her opinion, BFR (and ", "point-to-point Earth transport", ") will be deployed \u201cwithin a decade, ", "for sure", ".\u201d Prices would nominally be \u201cbetween business and economy,\u201d or a few thousand dollars per person.

Perhaps most importantly, she qualified her timeline estimates as \u201cGwynne-time\u201d when Anderson jokingly deadpanned about the infamous Elon-time. Overall, Shotwell came across as more bullish than she has ever been before on BFR\u2019s development and future prospects, including both point-to-point transport on Earth and crewed missions to the surface of Mars \u2013 both of which she expected to begin \u201cwithin a decade, for sure.\u201d Smirking, she quipped that she was \u201csure Elon would want us to go faster.\u201d", "Not one to end on a quiet note, the typically pragmatic executive finished by describing how she believed that spreading human presence throughout the Sol System was only \u201cthe first step [towards] moving to other solar systems and potentially other galaxies; I think this is the only time I ever out-vision Elon.\u201d Interstellar travel and faster-than-light propulsion aspirations aside, Shotwell\u2019s comments mark a fairly incredible shift in attitude toward SpaceX\u2019s far loftier ambitions. Musk seems to be working to recalibrate his timelines to be less naive at the same time as Shotwell\u2019s confidence is steadily growing \u2013 the two executives, in other words, appear to be rapidly converging upon a middle ground of pragmatic optimism (that or Musk-time is contagious!).", "As shown above, the level of construction activity at SpaceX\u2019s Texas testing facilities is fairly impressive and could perhaps be seen as evidence that both Musk and Shotwell are speaking from a place of something approaching pragmatism. While the purpose of the new stand (center) is not yet clear, several aspects indicate that it is unlikely to be more mundane. First, the massive water tower (one that did not exist just a month or two ago, might I add) dwarfs anything found at individual engine or upper stage test stands at the SpaceX facility. It\u2019s possible that the existence of the flame trench alone necessitates the inclusion of such a large water suppression system for damage prevention, but the presence of the blue steel skeleton of a new flame bucket (operational iterations shown on the right) suggests otherwise. For example, the Merlin stands have no such water suppression system: they do use water suppression to avoid damaging the ground systems or the engines themselves, but that water is stored in a large ground-level tank. A tower, however, indicates that SpaceX wants much higher water pressures and flow rates to be available at the new stand, a requirement for significantly more powerful tests akin to SpaceX\u2019s full-up Falcon 9 (and Heavy) test stand \u2013 the water towers at the S1 stand and this new stand appear to be identical in size.", "In other words, it\u2019s more probable than not that this new stand is being built to support either booster static fires or much larger tests of BFR hardware (perhaps multiple Raptors at once, akin to SpaceX\u2019s very early tests of Falcon 9\u2019s nine Merlins).

After separating from the second stage, events relating to Falcon 9\u2019s first stage recovery operations were heard live in the background of SpaceX\u2019s live coverage, leading to some additional intrigue around an already odd situation.", "B1032, a flight-proven (reused) booster tasked with launching GovSat-1 on its second mission, was ", "seen with landing legs and grid fins", " on its sooty exterior \u2013 a confusing appearance due to SpaceX\u2019s statement that the core would be expended into the ocean after launch. Thankfully, Elon Musk\u2019s tweets provide at least the beginning of an answer for the several oddities.", "As stated above, GovSat-1\u2019s Falcon 9 booster (1032) was apparently being used to test an exceptionally aggressive landing burn in lieu of a drone ship beneath it. The lack of drone ship begins to make more sense with the added knowledge that 1032 was testing experimental landing procedures: in the relatively likely eventuality that something went wrong, the massive booster would have likely impacted ", "Of Course I Still Love You", " at an extremely high velocity. Similar impacts have occurred before as SpaceX gradually perfected the new technologies and operational knowledge necessary to recover orbital-class rockets, but a basic understanding of rocketry implies that 1032\u2019s OCISLY impact would have been uniquely destructive, likely taking the ship out of action for at least several weeks of repairs.", "This would pose an inherent problem for the imminent launch of Falcon Heavy, with the center of three first stages currently scheduled to attempt a landing aboard the very same drone ship in less than a week. Under optimum conditions (sans huge explosions and general destruction), OCISLY and its entourage of support vessels simply could not complete the journey back to Port Canaveral and the subsequent return to sea that would have been necessary to recovery both GovSat-1 and Falcon Heavy\u2019s center core. Add in the potential need for repairs and expending GovSat-1 was a no-brainer for the launch company: Falcon Heavy\u2019s center core could easily see at least one additional launch after it is recovered, whereas the twice-used 1032 effectively reached the end of its useful life after it separated from the second stage and GovSat payload earlier today.", "As a result, SpaceX appears to have continued a trend of exploiting flight test opportunities to the greatest extent practicable by tasking B1032 with an experimental landing attempt. More specifically, Elon quickly added that the landing burn attempted by 1032 involved the ignition of three of the booster\u2019s nine Merlin 1D engines\u00a0", "during", " landing, whereas all SpaceX landings up to this point have occurred with a single Merlin 1D ignition. While the company already routinely utilizes three engines during some\u00a0", "boostback", " and\u00a0", "reentry", " burns,\u00a0", "landing", " burns have always featured a single engine. However, by using three engines, it is entirely possible that SpaceX hopes to eventually move towards even more aggressive landing burns. While the obvious downsides likely include difficulty maintaining control and increased stresses on the booster, the benefits are also pretty inherent. By using more engines, the length of the landing burn could be drastically shortened, resulting in far more efficient propellant usage by minimizing losses to gravity (every second the rocket is trying to go upwards is a second fighting against Earth\u2019s gravity, which pulls the rocket down at ~9.8 meters/second squared).", "Incredibly, the booster somehow managed to pull off that three engine landing burn with some success, made apparent by the fact that it is intact and floating in the Atlantic, with some hope of being towed back to land. This is almost certainly the first time SpaceX has ever successfully landed a booster in the ocean without a subsequent breakup, an incredible achievement for a rocket that likely experienced exceptional stresses during reentry and landing. Time will tell how this impacts SpaceX\u2019s future recovery efforts, but it is certainly promising as a method of extracting just a little extra performance from reusable Falcon 9s. In other words, future Falcon 9 missions might be able to carry heavier payloads into higher orbits while still being able to land at sea or even on land. Exciting times!"]},

Of the five missions, two require a direct geostationary orbit (GEO) insertion, one to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), and two to a medium Earth orbit (MEO) of ~7000 km.

Once it rose vertically above the majority of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the rocket angled over until it was essentially thrusting parallel to Earth\u2019s surface. Think of it like spinning a ball on a string: only after a certain speed will the ball successfully spin in a circle \u2013 spin too slow and the ball will simply fall.

A famous analogy can be found in a simple tennis ball: thrown normally, the ball will arc over and eventually fall to the ground. However, if a ball is thrown fast enough (and was also able to avoid being incinerated by friction against the atmosphere), one can imagine the ball going over the horizon, traveling around the Earth, and coming right back to the thrower.", "Amazingly, this becomes a far more reasonable proposition when dealing with asteroids, comets, and moons with much light gravity than Earth\u2019s \u201c1G.\u201d For example, on Mars\u2019 tiny moon Phobos, an astronaut could very nearly escape from the moon by\u00a0", "running", ", and could almost effortlessly throw a ball fast enough to orbit Phobos (a blistering 25 mph would be required).

The first point of stability (when you are going faster forward than the Earth can pull you down) is called \u201clow Earth orbit,\u201d (LEO) being roughly the lowest height and velocity necessary to stably orbit the Earth.

Famously, astronauts and satellites at this altitude travel around the Earth once every 90 minutes, half in pure sunlight, half in the darkness of Earth\u2019s own shadow \u2013 essentially a special sunrise and sunset every three-quarter of an hour.", "Now, expand that model of Earth and the Roadster in orbit around it to the entire solar system. In this model, Earth and all other objects are orbiting the Sun at different distances and speeds, like different bands of the same tree ring. The solar system is massive, however, and thus everything has to be scaled up: for example, the Earth orbits the Sun at\u00a0", "30 kilometers per second", " (~70,000 mph), nearly four times faster than our humble Tesla in LEO.", "Remember: when orbiting Earth, objects are still under the firm hold of the planet\u2019s gravity, but merely moving so fast that they are in a constant state of freefall.

On the scale of the solar system, Roadster\u2019s journey away from Earth can be thought of like, well, a Roadster making its way to the top of a steep hill. After climbing to the top, the Roadster is nearly out of energy but has just enough to accelerate as it begins its way down the other side.

Similarly, evidenced by Earth and all the other planets in the solar system, orbiting the sun is typically very stable \u2013 humans do not exactly live in fear of the Earth falling into the sun, we just keep going around and around.

Now, that is not to say that future human explorers millions of years from now would recognize whatever remained \u2013 deep space is characterized by a relatively extreme radiation environment that will not be kind to many components that make up the Roadster\u2019s structure.

While high energy radiation found in deep space can and likely will shred the Tesla\u2019s structural integrity and eventually bleach or discolor the car, the Roadster will be perfectly suspended in microgravity (basically zero gravity) conditions with almost no chance whatsoever of impacts by even tiny space debris like micrometeorites. If an aspiring car collector tried to recover the eccentric and historic trophy from space in several centuries/millennia, Roadster would very likely fall to pieces or even crumble to dust when moved or placed in an environment with any significant gravity. But, it will almost without a doubt retain its recognizable shape almost indefinitely, at least on a human scale. Starman can be expected to react very similarly.", "Finally, it appears that SpaceX has not installed any method of power generation or communication on Starman\u2019s ride, meaning that humans likely saw their last views of the vehicle after SpaceX cut the live feed to Starman. This sadly means that there will be no photo ops with Starman soaring past Mars or exploring the asteroid belt, although that option will certainly be reserved for any future eccentric, Muskian test payloads.", "\u00a0", "Ultimately, this final success is an invaluable cherry on top of ", "what was already a stunning achievement.", " Without a single scrubbed launch attempt or unintended hold during the final countdown, ", "SpaceX\u2019s first launch", " of what is now the most capable operational rocket in the world was a perfect success in almost all regards.

{"date": "February 13, 2018", "headline": "How SpaceX Falcon Heavy undercuts its competition three-fold", "tag": "News", "author": "Eric Ralph", "text": ["Following the stunningly successful debut of SpaceX\u2019s giant Falcon Heavy rocket, the spaceflight fan community and industry have been abuzz with attempts to estimate Falcon Heavy\u2019s true price as an expendable or partially expendable launch vehicle. Thankfully, CEO Elon Musk appears to have been interested enough to fill in the knowledge gaps concerning the rocket\u2019s full range of prices and took to Twitter to answer several questions.", "Among several other intriguing comments that I will cover later on, Musk revealed that a fully expendable Falcon Heavy would cost approximately $150 million, while a partially expendable FH would sport 90% of the performance while expending the center stage and landing the side boosters at sea rather than on land. In that latter mode of operation, a Falcon Heavy launch would cost about $95 million, whereas unlocking the final 10% of performance with a fully expandable configuration would be priced around $150 million. While $90-150 million is undeniably a huge amount of cash in any sense, Falcon Heavy delivers far more performance for\u00a0multiple times less than the available competition.", "The only real competition for Falcon Heavy is the United Launch Alliance\u2019s (ULA) Delta IV Heavy rocket, a triple-core launch vehicle with nine total launches under its belt since its 2004 debut. Aside from one test launch for NASA, all of DIVH\u2019s operational flights have been tasked with launching uniquely heavy military payloads to uniquely high orbits \u2013 both of which require an exceptionally capable rocket. Designed as a fully expendable vehicle, ULA\u2019s Heavy is capable of launching ~29,000 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO) and ~14,000 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), whereas the fully reusable Falcon Heavy has a max payload of about 23,000 kg to LEO and 8,000 kg to GTO.", "However, if Musk\u2019s claim of 10% performance loss as a partially expendable launcher holds true, the story changes quite a bit. In its fully expendable configuration (call it the Delta IV Heavy config), Falcon Heavy is a beast of a rocket, quoted at ~64,000 kg to LEO and 26,700 kg to GTO. Subtract 10-25%, and Falcon Heavy still trounces the Delta rocket, all while costing well under $150 million, and probably closer to $100 million. According to a late-", "2017 report from the US Government Accountability Office", ", Delta IV Heavy costs as much as $400 million per launch, although ULA CEO Tory Bruno responded to Musk\u2019s claim of $400-600 million earlier this morning with a figure of $350 million for the rocket.", "Such a high price is not exceptionally surprising, if only for the fact that Delta IV Heavy launches as infrequently as it does. With an average cadence of one launch every 18 months or 1.5 years, the technical expertise and facilities required to design, build, and operate the DIVH must remain employed regardless of whether the rocket launches. Although Delta was previously a family of rockets, thus enabling some of its designers and builders to cross-populate, the final non-Heavy Delta launch occurred just a handful of weeks ago. Short of layoffs, this means that ULA\u2019s Delta expertise are now solely working to build and operate a rocket with approximately seven launches scheduled between 2018 and 2023 \u2013 in short, $400 million is quite plausibly on the low end of the rocket\u2019s actual cost, backend included. Both ULA and the Department of Defense are aware, however, that Delta IV Heavy is the only rocket currently capable of launching some of the missions desired and required by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and are thus at least partially willing to swallow the vehicle\u2019s high cost. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy is bound to introduce some much-needed competition into the stagnant market after its highly successful introduction, but it will likely be a year or more before the new rocket is certified to launch the same highly sensitive and expensive payloads as ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy.", "Still, this does not answer the \u201chow\u201d of SpaceX\u2019s prices. What can even begin to explain Delta IV Heavy\u2019s 200-400% premium over Falcon Heavy? The best answer to this crucial question was by no coincidence also one of the main reasons that Elon Musk created SpaceX. From the very beginning,\u00a0SpaceX pursued a slim and flexible organizational structure, prioritized hiring brilliant and motivated engineers with hands-on experience, and encouraged the practice of thinking from first principles. Dolly Singh, head of SpaceX\u2019s talent acquisition in the mid-2000s, ", "described the rocket startup\u2019s atmosphere like so", ":", "We searched for candidates with a proven history of ", "building", " and breaking things\u2026candidates who had been tinkering with hardware systems for years\u2026I knew the people who filled my open positions would be put to the test every day and would be asked to meet heretofore impossible targets. We looked for people with a history of defeating the odds, who had made careers of overcoming obstacles.", "In essence, this organizational philosophy has led SpaceX to become vertically integrated to the extent that is effective without comparison in the global aerospace industry. Vertical integration is a term used to describe the practice of bringing aspects of development and manufacturing\u00a0", "in-house", ", whereas a company not attempting to integrate vertically would instead contract and subcontract out their design and manufacturing needs wherever possible. Musk is hard set on this philosophy: if SpaceX can do it in-house more cheaply than a contractor, they will become their own supplier. Companies like ULA \u2013 a cooperation between Lockheed Martin and Boeing \u2013 have the better part of a century of experience as heavyweights in the US military-industrial complex, a relationship that has quite literally changed processes of acquisition and created alternate realities of pricing.", "Thick with armies of lobbyists, those military-industrial complex titans have help to direct the US down a path that has solidified truly insane concepts as the status quo. A ", "c", "ost-plus\u00a0", "contracting framework almost universally applied in the procurement of military technology means that companies are nearly\u00a0", "awarded", " for delays and cost overruns. Possibly even more absurd, the euphemistic strategy of \u201cconcurrency\u201d espoused by those same titans has somehow convinced the upper echelons of US defense procurement that it is a good and preferable strategy to fully fund and build technologies en mass before\u00a0", "any", " testing has been. Unsurprisingly, these two philosophies have led to years of delays and huge cost overruns as contractors and their subcontractors are forced to repair or modify extremely complex technological systems once bugs and problems are inevitably discovered down the road.

", "Tyler Rogowa", "y, one of the best practicing defense journalists, ", "has covered the debacle", " of\u00a0concurrency and cost-plus contracting for many years and is a recommended read for anyone interested in the above industries.", "Parting from this partial diversion, the purpose of this brief history of military procurement is to provide some level of context as to why NASA and its spaceflight contractors act as they do, where they derived their organizational structures and philosophies, and why SpaceX is different.", "Famously, a NASA study in 2010 estimated the cost of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 development to be approximately $4 billion under variables representative of NASA\u2019s own R&D and engineering culture, or $1.7 billion using a more commercial, fixed-cost strategy. When SpaceX offered to cooperate with the addition of their internal data on Falcon 9\u2019s cost, the same model\u2019s estimate plummeted to less than $600 million, representing a truly extraordinary overestimate of SpaceX\u2019s development costs, while SpaceX\u2019s data showed approximately $300 million of investment in the first version of Falcon 9. Simply put,\u00a0", "NASA\u2019s cost estimates were off by", "\u00a0", "more", " than an order of magnitude", "\u00a0(PDF)\u00a0\u2013", "\u00a0", "SpaceX successfully developed an unprecedented orbital-class rocket for mere pennies to NASA\u2019s dollar.", "More recently, Elon Musk has stated that SpaceX invested $1 billion or more in the development of reusability for Falcon 9, and this large investment can almost entirely explain why Falcon 9\u2019s pricing has remained essentially unchanged over its seven years of life, even if it was already the cheapest rocket in its performance class. Despite the recent introduction and rapid routinization of operational reuse, SpaceX has not publicly changed the launch price from its $62 million base. Although there have been slight acknowledgments of small discounts from customers flying on reused boosters, the general theme is that reused rockets have not meaningfully lowered the cost of purchasing a launch. In practice, the cost of refurbishment and reuse of the first several Falcon 9 boosters was likely on par with the cost of a new booster, but the real reason for the lack of magnitudes of cost reduction lies in SpaceX\u2019s desire to recoup some or all of the capital it invested in reusability. As the company matures its reuse expertise, the cost can be expected to plummet \u2013 Cargo Dragon\u2019s reuse, for example, ", "reportedly saved SpaceX 50% of the cost of a new capsule", ", and Falcon 9 is almost certainly far easier and thus cheaper to refurbish and refly.", "While payload fairings have turned out to be harder to recover than anticipated and Falcon 9\u2019s second stage is likely to remain expendable for the foreseeable future, those components only comprise about 30% of the rocket\u2019s price. If SpaceX can cut the cost of reuse to maybe 10-20% of the cost of a new booster, the remaining 30-60% of a new launch\u2019s $62 million translates to approximately $20-35 million of profit for\u00a0", "each\u00a0", "reused launch. If, say, the company aims to fly flight-proven boosters on half of their launches in 2018, that translates into as many as 15 launches and as much as $500 million \u2013 or half of the $1 billion investment \u2013 recouped in a single year. With the introduction of Falcon 9 Block 5 in a few months, SpaceX will soon be flying an iteration of their workhorse rocket that is\u00a0", "far", " faster, easier, and cost-effective to reuse. Ultimately, depending on how much of their initial investment SpaceX intends to recover, the huge profit margins they can derive from reuse could be redirected to drastic price cuts for the customer. More realistically, the company will likely lower its prices enough to ensure that their launch business is brutally competitive, and thus use those profit margins to begin heavily investing in BFR (Big F. Rocket), BFS (Big F. Spaceship), and the company\u2019s loftier interplanetary goals more generally.", "In fact, given that SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has quite consistently targeted early 2019 for the beginning of prototype BFS testing, SpaceX is probably already putting a significant proportion of their profits into Mars-focused R&D. As 2018 progresses, barring any unseen speed bumps, the funds available to SpaceX are bound to explode, and huge progress will likely begin to be made on actual hardware intended to enable colonies on the Moon and Mars.", "Follow along live as launch photographer Tom Cross and I cover these exciting proceedings as close to live as possible.", "Teslarati", "\u00a0 \u00a0\u2013\u00a0 \u00a0", "Instagram ", "\u2013 ", "Twitter", "Tom Cross", " \u2013 ", "Twitter", "Eric Ralph\u00a0", "\u2013 ", "Twitter", "\u00a0"]},

While the company appeared to have recovered at least one large fragment on the East coast, success has proven elusive, and CEO Elon Musk noted in press conferences before and after Falcon Heavy\u2019s inaugural launch that the task had proven more difficult than was anticipated. Despite the difficulties, SpaceX has no intention of surrendering their valuable fairings (a $5 million pallet of cash, as Musk once joked) to the sea.", "Along with the imminent introduction of SpaceX\u2019s upgraded \u201cFairing 2.0\u201d on ", "the upcoming Wednesday launch of PAZ", ", chances of a successful fairing recovery are almost certainly higher than ever before. While SpaceX and CEO Musk has only revealed that the upgraded fairing is somewhat larger than its predecessor, it can also be more or less guaranteed that its aforementioned upgrades go well beyond larger dimensions, likely extending into improved reusability hardware, greater ease of manufacture, and much more. This should come as no surprise \u2013 SpaceX has a long and storied history of making constant, iterative improvements to all aspects of itself, be it hardware, software, design, or manufacturing.", "Enter Mr. Steven\u2019s fancy new netting. While no bouncy castle, a highly maneuverable vessel with an effortlessly reusable net is arguably far superior to a dead-in-the-water piece of inflatable plastic. As the fairing (theoretically) floats gently down to the surface of the ocean under its guided parachute, Mr. Steven\u2019s coxswain will be tasked with skillfully maneuvering the boat to account for any the sea state and any winds in order to maintain its position at the fairing\u2019s destination. If all goes well, at least half of Falcon 9\u2019s payload fairing will gently drop into Mr. Steven\u2019s net, marking SpaceX\u2019s first successful recovery. If things don\u2019t go exactly as planned, a 1000kg hunk of metal and composite could theoretically smash into poor Mr. Steven at an unhealthy velocity. However, things are looking considerably more positive this time around.", "By all appearances, SpaceX has retained the same general strategy of fairing recovery mentioned in the past by Musk and other executives. To oversimplify, after launch, the payload fairing separates (mechanically) from the second stage once Falcon 9 or Heavy has left behind the majority of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. After separation, each fairing half orients itself for a gentler reentry into the atmosphere with cold nitrogen gas thrusters, likely the exact same thrusters used in part to achieve Falcon 9\u2019s accurate and reliable landings. Due to their massive surface area and comparatively tiny weight, fairing halves effectively become exceptionally finicky and awkward sails ", "falling through the atmosphere at insane velocities", ", with the goal generally being to orient each half like a boat\u2019s hull to provide ", "some", " stability.

I remembered the powerful imagery of sheets of ice cracking under the sudden thrust, breaking away from the booster and vaporizing in the roaring fire that was as bright as The Sun, and I wanted to capture that. It took every bit of 15 minutes to set up these two cameras, with no time for handheld shots.", "On the bus, I opened Instagram to update the story about my remote cameras and saw that Elon had liked my image of Falcon Heavy that I had just posted. An affirmation that I am photographing their rockets in the way he wants them displayed, I thought to myself. Needless to say, I was ecstatic.", "Just as quickly,\u00a0 it was time to get off the bus again at a new location North of the launchpad. I hadn\u2019t been here before, so I browsed around, contemplated if I should set up my third camera here, but decided to pass on it because of the exhaust plume that would inevitably get in the way of the rocket. Instead, I took a few head-on photos of Falcon Heavy and noticed a group of people beneath it, who appeared\u00a0like ants compared to the rocket. It became obvious to me this was a giant ready to crush gravity, change the industry, and rock the world.\u00a0Back on the bus, I edited the photos and posted them on the way to the next location.

Everyone got off the bus and took time to take pictures of each other, with Falcon Heavy on the launch pad serving as a remarkable backdrop. We made some fun selfies and everyone took a moment for themselves to absorb the scenery and reflect on what we were doing. This was a once in a lifetime experience.", "Back on the bus, I edited a group of photos and posted a series of them onto our social media accounts. As the Sun set just above the launch pad, I setup my iPhone to do a live stream on Instagram to share the experience with our fans. I saw that Elon liked the group of images I had posted just minutes earlier.", "The day was coming to an end, everything was go for launch and there was an overall good vibe in the air, lots of excitement for the launch the next day. On the bus ride back, I was thinking about the struggles and triumphs and sacrifices that had led up to this launch for SpaceX and for myself. Knowing Elon was around on property after seeing his entourage buzz by more than a couple times, I thought I\u2019d type a respectful direct message in the off-chance that he might read it. It said, ", "\u201cHey Elon, Tom here, if time allows or we cross paths tomorrow, would love to shake your hand and maybe get a quick selfie with you.

I was pleased to see the polite man from Amsterdam was the winner.", "When Chris finished, we all walked out together then someone in the next room recognized him. Clearly this person had a high regard for Chris, having likely heard him during his twitter live streams and seen him on NASA TV. We each greeted the person, who began to ask Chris a few questions. Chris took the time to answer each of them completely and I saw the look on his face change. I sensed how lucky and excited he felt to have been able to personally meet Chris at this launch, and for this moment he was able to have a one-on-one with him. I tapped Brady on the shoulder and we left them alone.", "That brief moment was the first time it occurred to me that we can have quite an impact on space enthusiasts by sharing information and our unique vision, sometimes it resonates with people; they really get it, look forward to it, and enjoy it.", "After this encounter, Chris, Brady, and I went to a correspondents meet up hosted by ", "Robin", ", Chelsea and Matt; it was a good time for networking and unwinding after the long day of launch activities. By the time we arrived, many people had already eaten pizza, had a drink in hand and offered us one when we walked in the door.

An hour into the drive, nearing the Kennedy Space Center, my GPS told me there was a 9-minute delay due to heavy traffic. I was rather early, craving another coffee, so I texted Chris \u201cAre the chances of Falcon Heavy launching greater than the press center having coffee for us?\u201d He laughed and said \u201cTotally.\u201d So I went out of the way to Starbucks.", "On the way back to KSC, the traffic had seemed to clear until I crossed the drawbridge, which was bumper to bumper again.

Eventually, the entire left-lane was kept cleared by police for employees to get to work on time. I switched to that lane and drove to a badging location just outside the checkin gate that was still closed to press, so I waited in the parking lot until 10am before checking in.

In between reading articles I\u2019d comment on something, checkout Brady\u2019s photo, then, Pauline told us that her camera slipped out of her bag and landed on the front element this morning. When we met the day before, I noticed that we both have the same camera bag. My wife got me one as a Christmas gift. It is uniquely designed and I had to learn how it worked through a youtube video. I like it a lot but haven\u2019t quite figured out where I prefer to put everything. I asked her how she packed hers and if she liked it \u2013 \u201cStill getting used it.\u201d, she told me. I only saw one other photographer with the same bag. Luckily, Pauline had a UV filter on the lens when it slipped out and hit the ground.

His reply was simply \u201cif I see you, sure.\u201d", "When Brady got back I showed him and Pauline the message and they were thrilled. Moments later, we got a call that it was time to load the bus to head out to the causeway for launch. They will leave you if you\u2019re not there in time so we rushed out to board.

Falcon Heavy had just started to vent liquid oxygen for the first time! The ads were still rolling but coming to an end, so I picked up my camera and quickly captured some images of the LOX venting. I heard them beginning to start the segment. I immediately dropped my camera and greeted them, expecting to roll right into the talking points we prepared consisting of rocket industry competitiveness, launch costs, Tesla, and SpaceX. They started off by asking me a very simple opening question: What it looked like outside and how the weather was. I had prepared for everything but this. Having dealt with weather issues part of the day, my first thought was unpleasant, I stumbled trying to gather my thoughts and said: \u201cWe were on the edge of scrub because of windy conditions.\u201d I avoided mentioning the 2 1/2 hours sitting on a bus not expecting the launch to occur. Instead, I mentioned the concern about dynamics of the boosters going through the crosswinds and derailed the interview and began to fumble.", "The SpaceX live stream was running in the background, the speaker got louder, another puff of LOX vented, I still couldn\u2019t gather my thoughts. I stopped, took a breath, apologized, and broke the ice by saying I was nervous.

Is this Tesla going to space? It was all taking place 6 miles away, I was captivated by it while trying to concentrate on the interview. They continued to conduct the interview, none of the talking points touched on yet but it was fine. I felt I had already gone belly-up, I\u2019m here in this moment so let\u2019s talk about it, I thought.", "Then they asked if I was confident it would fly, I said \u201cAbsolutely, SpaceX is a talented team of artists who have done the impossible more than once, I think it\u2019s going to be a complete success.\u201d The interview went on a bit more and near the end, I think I was able to make two points from the notes \u2013 The competing rocket costs $400 million and carries half the payload. Falcon Heavy costs $90 million and Russia charges Nasa about $90 million for a single seat to the ISS \u2013 that\u2019s nothing to joke about, this rocket will change the industry.

I read a few messages; people were greeting me from China, Italy, Istanbul, I was thrilled. People all around the world were watching this incredible moment in history. I explained that I was going to leave my phone running while I took photos, they would hear my reaction and probably see it, thumbs up rolled across the screen. I got into position for launch.", "I could hear the countdown on the live stream while I was standing with my eye in the camera. 5 seconds before launch a lot of exhaust billowed from the launch pad and for those 5 seconds, I held my breath as the clock ticked to 0 and I saw the orange flame creep up from beneath the rocket. I immediately held down my finger on the shutter button as the rocket ascended and cleared the tower \u2013 the whole time saying \u201coh my god\u201d repeatedly when I actually wanted to blurt out a bunch of childish profanity but remembered the live stream was running.", "As the rocket cleared the tower, I positioned my camera to capture a tall-portrait for scale. It flew higher and then it began arching over. The Earth rumbling sound from the 27 Merlin engines had traveled 6 miles across the water to my location and I could feel it in my feet and chest.

I commented on how the rumble could still be heard.", "I followed the second stage for as long as it was visible and prepared to capture the booster return.

The boosters were closer together than I had imagined they would be, this was really like synchronized booster landings, totally mind-blowing. I ran up a hill for a better view of the landing and I captured the boosters free falling in tandem, they pierced through a cloud and each ignited with a bright green burst of fire \u2013 The landing burn was in progress.", " ", "I held my finger on the shutter, captured the landing legs unfolding, and one after another, seconds apart, both boosters rumbled to their designated landing pad and touched down. Both had just sprinted to space, flipped around over our heads, came screaming down to Earth, slowed their freefall, and stuck perfect landings side by side. Moments after touchdown the six sonic booms rattled everything and I flipped-out cheering with everyone else who had just experienced this. I quickly uploaded the images to my laptop, edited the first few, and sent them to the team. I posted one on Twitter and Instagram, then Reddit.

They were being told to move inside.", "I went inside and handed ", "Pauline", " her camera, she was excited when she saw the images it captured.

I had been working all day, was extremely hungry, very excited from the launch, and realized this was the only time I\u2019d cross paths with Elon. I respectfully approached a Security officer, showed him the message from Elon, and said \u201cI know Security is tight, but I was wondering if I could shake his hand and get a selfie with him when we arrive.\u201d The security officer read it and told me, \u201cYou should have scheduled this with the SpaceX media coordinators earlier.\u201d As the three black SUVs rolled up and came to a stop, he told me in a firm voice \u201cYou need to go inside or go down the hill, you can\u2019t be here right now.\u201d I politely walked away toward the press center doors.

They didn\u2019t even need to land these boosters I thought, they just did it to prove they could \u2013\u00a0 this is incredible. He went on about the space suit being a real qualification model, you could wear it in a vacuum chamber, and he made some comments about how funny it\u2019d be if aliens found the car and wondered why there was a tiny car on the dashboard, a friend gave him the idea to do that.", "As I watched him share with everyone this raw mix of serious and humorous experiences, I recalled reading in his biography all the struggles he\u2019s had growing up and then becoming a businessman.

He then borrowed money for rent, went through a treacherous divorce, nearly lost both companies in the economic downturn, so he had to choose to save one company and lose the other. The book said he would wake up in the night screaming sometimes during the most stressful time of his life.", "Here he is now because he never gave up on his vision and he pushed himself to follow through. Through determination, intelligence, perseverance, and wit, and rolling with the punches, he was able to save both companies and sell Solarcity to Tesla. He continually beat all the odds and he\u2019s living the best moments of his life now.", "That Roadster was the beginning of Tesla, a heavy-lift rocket had been a dream of his since the beginning of SpaceX \u2013 The payload is something to everybody on Earth, at least a PR stunt.

Everyone came into the press building and gathered around for mission patches \u2013 a tradition after every successful launch. While gathered around, some people commented on the SpaceX live stream, showed each other their photos, talked about the press conference, then I heard Brady shocking gasp \u201cOh my god.\u201d", "Before anyone asked, I knew what that reaction meant. \u201cElon just retweeted my photo!\u201d he said. We all high-fived him and he was pacing the room with a smile ear-to-ear. I reminded him that he said he\u2019d pass out, and should probably sit down. He laughed and was in disbelief and beside himself excited.", "Brady is a professional photographer in Michigan, shooting portraits, weddings, and sports, but he\u2019s truly passionate about space. I know he would love to come to every launch but he invests thousands of dollars to travel and stay in a hotel, even through delays and scrubs, to photograph high profile launches and be part of the program. I was happy for him that he\u2019d finally gotten the highest recognition for his work.", "We received our patches and decided to go out to eat as a group to celebrate the launch.", "We went to the usual location, a popular bar called Preachers on Cocoa Beach, the food is good and they make me fresh coffee. It\u2019s a small bar, has extra large tables and little standing room, sometimes you sit with strangers. Chris noticed a former Space Shuttle Astronaut was sitting at the table behind us.", "We all took over a table that had a couple sitting at it, when they left, we moved down to claim the entire table. I sat on one side with Chris, Pauline sat across from me and next to her was Brady with his laptop and phone out. He was editing photos and watching his Twitter stats skyrocket. He was as happy as I\u2019d ever seen him. I don\u2019t even think he realized food was available or felt much like eating, as he was running on adrenaline and excitement.", "The server came up to us and asked what type of drinks we were having, Chris said, \u201cI know 4-waters for sure, and you better make a pot of coffee for this guy \u2013 pointing at me, and I\u2019ll have a beer.\u201d I asked for 2 cups of coffee because I was going to drink one before she came back for food orders. Brady and Pauline also ordered separate drinks.", "As we waited, we talked about the launch and I asked everyone when they knew it\u2019d make it. Chris told me \u201cWhen it cleared the tower.\u201d There was a Canadian Science Channel crew filming his reaction. He warned them that he\u2019d scream, and he said he held his breath until it cleared the tower then cheered. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see their footage from that moment!\u201d he said while laughing at himself. I told him I knew it\u2019d make it when it performed the roll maneuver.", "A couple more people came to our table who I hadn\u2019t met at the press site.

Pauline joined on the conversation and we shared interesting stories, fun facts, photos, cool memories, etc.", "The topic came up of ", "why I\u2019m so passionate about rocket photography", ". I explained that the art is the machine and the launch. The people who design it and build it and make it happen are the artists. It\u2019s the leading edge of what humanity is capable of. Over time we discovered elements, studied them, mixed materials, created alloys, shaped them, figured out chemistry and combustion, put this inside these specially fabricated works of art that rocket engines are and figured out through multiple explosions how to finally harness the raw power of nature to go back out into the universe with the materials the universe left here on Earth for us.", "I\u2019m fascinated by the insanely high standards, methods of manufacturing, and how you need to be a certain caliber of person to work in an environment that produces these machines, have the talent to do it perfectly and consistently, nothing in the design is disregarded as not worth changing or improving, nature will beat the crap out of you if you get lazy. I am so inspired by this. So it\u2019s about humans figuring out the unwritten rules of nature, building these rockets, and going into space, and pushing the species forward. That\u2019s what I try to capture when I take photographs \u2013 that\u2019s the art to me. Jay, Josh, and Pauline listened intently and didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, I thought I lost them from rambling on. Pauline said, \u201cA friend of mine is coming here, he was at the SpaceX party where the employees were, you need to meet him.\u201d", "We ordered food, I got a burger, and refills on my 2 coffees. While I ate everyone talked among themselves then a group of people came into the bar, one person, in particular, was rather loud. He told everyone he patted Elon on the back and told him \u201cGood job.\u201d, then he showed everyone this awesome photo that was posted, he held it up and said \u201cHave you guys seen this? Check it out!\u201d and it was Brady\u2019s photo. Someone said, \u201cYeah! We\u2019ve seen it, the photographer is sitting right there!\u201d Eyes glued to the laptop, Brady was unaware he had an audience from this person and a couple of people who wanted to see more photos asked him and he was happy to share.", "I continued eating then Pauline said, \u201cHe\u2019s here, come meet him.\u201d We walked over to where Chris and Thaddeus and some others were standing, she introduced me to her friend. She said he built Merlin Rocket Engines and does quality checks on them and also checks out all the boosters that go out before launch. I was blown away, thrilled to shake his hand and told him who I was. I said, \u201cI probably have a thousand things to say and want to ask like an enthusiastic child, but I\u2019m going to chill out.\u201d He laughed, shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can, ask away.\u201d", "I started by telling him why I am so passionate about photographing the rockets, I showed him some of my photos from the launch, and I asked what the experience was like for him. He said, \u201cI was so happy, I had tears running down my face the whole time! I had my hands on those boosters, I checked out those engines, I made sure it was good to go when it left the factory.\u201d I sensed that a part of him launched with that rocket.", "I continued on asking about the culture, the methods, standards, all the way to the brand of tools that are used. He politely shared what he was allowed to. He asked me where I was during the Amos-6 explosion, I said \u201cI was sleeping and woke up to a friends text that showed the video, I thought it was fake.\u201d He said, \u201cWe have TVs in the factory that show us the launchpads so we can stay involved in whats happening outside the walls, someone yelled \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d as we watched it explode. I asked if anyone left work early distraught after that. \u201cHell no.\u201d he said. \u201cWe have production to meet.\u201d", "He continued to tell Pauline and I how there are things he\u2019s refused that didn\u2019t pass quality inspection and he\u2019s had to tell Elon \u2018no\u2019 before and explain why. He said, \u201cElon is always around, although he doesn\u2019t announce it, he sometimes walks to your station and observes you working, he likes to watch you in your natural work environment. If he asks you something and you say no, or give an opinion on something, you\u2019d better have your shit together to back it up. I\u2019ve seen him rip people apart with a series of questions. He\u2019ll take what you think you know, and not only go outside the box with it, he\u2019ll go out of the building with it and you\u2019ll be left dumbfounded about how it\u2019s directly related to what you\u2019re doing. He\u2019s whip-smart.\u201d I asked, \u201cDo people think does he does this to be an asshole? He said, \u201cNo. We\u2019re on the same team with the same focus, we are a small company, he needs to be this way.\u201d", "He told me engineers, fabricators, and assemblers really do work together. When an issue is discovered, its redesigned, made right, and installed, each of these issues can be expensive so they handle them fast and get it right. They have work orders to complete when building engines and such. I was absolutely captivated by this basic insight into the world of rocket manufacturing, this was an artist telling me about the studio, the creative processes, and I see and photograph the finished works. \u00a0I was running on fumes by this time, hardly able to listen attentively or make any sense so I said it was a pleasure to meet him and I said goodbye.", "I went around to everyone I spoke to that night and got selfies with them to remember the historic launch, the energy in the room was amazing and didn\u2019t want to forget these moments. I ran into Tim Dodd (Everyday Astronaut) and finally had a moment to chat with him before I left. We walked over to the side of the room and caught up. He mentioned my photos are really killing\u2019 it lately, since he\u2019s seeing them ", "everywhere", ". That was nice to hear. I told him I love what I\u2019m doing.", "I showed him the article ", "we wrote about his video", " of where to watch the launch from. I also showed him that a teacher asked me what would be the best for her 266 students to learn about space, I linked his videos to her. He was stoked and said, \u201cCan you believe a congressman told me they watch my videos to stay up to snuff?\u201d I said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s huge! They\u2019re great, I\u2019m not surprised!\u201d", "He then recalled us meeting a year earlier at a meet up he had at a small bar on Cocoa Beach before he became popular from Youtube. The only people who went to his meetup at the time were Brady and I. I had been photographing launches 6 months prior to meeting him that night. He was a press photographer and Brady and I had tickets for the Saturn V viewing. At the meet up I showed him some of my photos and he was blown away by most of them. Brady had some amazing shots too. He asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys shooting for someone?\u201d Brady already had something lined up. I said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought mine were up to par yet.\u201d Tim called BS on that and encouraged me to reach out. So I did, and my rocket photography press-journey began.", "Now a year later, here we were, at another meet up in a bar on Cocoa Beach. Both of us have worked all year producing content and struggled to find our niche and perfect our talents to create something that resonates with the public, and celebrating the biggest launch this generation had ever seen. I got a selfie with him and said \u2019til next time, then left Preachers.", "I drove home hardly keeping my eyes open but the happiest I could be.\u00a0I had been involved in this extraordinary launch that changed the world and the space industry. I was able to tell a story through photographs that resonated with so many people.", "The launch was a huge success, there\u2019s a freakin\u2019 Tesla in space now forevermore, and I worked with the most talented, interesting, passionate people and made everlasting friendships. I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and tell my wife all about it.", "A few days after launch, everyone I talked to said they were still high from it. I took an extra day or two to\u00a0catch up on work and to absorb the events that took place, then started to take my time editing my photos for prints.\u00a0People were messaging me about where to buy prints, so I created a website to share some of my work to others that wanted a moment in history on their walls.", "I felt we had all captured great photos of the launch but the one image that captured the essence of Falcon Heavy is the last one Elon posted. \u2013 Starman wearing a SpaceX spacesuit, cruising in a Tesla Roadster out to deep space, with a crescent Earth in the rearview mirror.", "Now let\u2019s talk about ", "how it got there", ".", "\u2013", "TomCross", "\u00a0"]},

SpaceX is preparing to send the Spanish government\u2019s PAZ imaging satellite skyward aboard the same rocket that launched Formosat-5 for the Taiwanese government in August 2017.", "Amazingly, this means that three of the four launches conducted by SpaceX in the last two months will have made use of reused Falcon 9 boosters, something I am choosing to take as foreshadowing for the coming months. By all appearances, the rocket company has been eminently successful in enacting a true industrial phase change towards the acceptance of flight-proven rocketry \u2013 a hard-earned achievement made possible by a combination of incredible reliability and unexpectedly positive responses from government agencies like NASA and the USAF.", "A relatively light payload, PAZ weighs in just shy of 1400 kg. However, despite a lack of confirmation, it is known that riding along with the imaging satellite are two highly significant prototype satellites, built by SpaceX itself. Deemed Microsat 2A and 2B in FCC licensing applications, the small 400 kg satellites will act as SpaceX\u2019s first-ever flight test of integrated satellite hardware \u2013 a massive step towards realizing the company\u2019s ", "dream of Starlink", ", a global internet constellation meant to provide service of the same caliber (or better\u2026) as providers like Comcast, Time Warner, and others. This will be a major moment if successful, and will make SpaceX the first US company to successfully ", "launch its first prototype internet satellites", " intended for low Earth orbit (200-1000 miles above Earth), a factor that would make them far more viable as a competitive alternative to ground-based internet than the current heavyweights in geostationary orbit (30,000+ miles above Earth).", "Those distances are crucial: such a long distance between user and terminal (60,000+ miles round trip) results in what the average person would consider \u201clag\u201d or simply unresponsive internet, where actions take as long as several seconds to register (such as clicking a link). This makes things like gaming, video chat, and more effectively unusable. However, thanks to the miniaturization enabled by the relentless progress of electronics technologies, tiny satellites (100-500 kg) with electric propulsion are rapidly becoming a viable alternative and threat to the massive (4000-8000 kg) communications satellites placed into geostationary orbit. Through mass production and lower costs to orbit, a giant network of magnitudes smaller satellites can realistically beat those giant satellites by being closer to the Earth. This means that more satellites in a given network will more frequently reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and be destroyed, requiring the constant launch of reinforcements, but this new paradigm is actually a viable strategy.", "SpaceX\u2019s own Microsats, prototypes for a constellation likely to be named Starlink, are quite possibly the most promising entrants among a sea of interested constellation operators. With the addition of laser-based communications links between each or most of the Starlink satellites planned to be placed in orbit, SpaceX\u2019s constellation will be truly unique in its extreme flexibility as a giant, global mesh network.", "By using lasers, latency (lag) will be far less significant and will enable SpaceX to distribute its network\u2019s availability beyond the capability of any individual satellite, known as a decentralized network. As always, SpaceX\u2019s choice to pursue such a configuration is extraordinarily ambitious. Still, the very fact that Microsat 2A and 2B are scheduled for launch just days from now suggests that the company\u2019s near-silent satellite development program, employing several hundred people all over the West coast, has seen some considerable successes.

According to CEO Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s fairing recovery vessel Mr. Steven missed the fairing by a few hundred meters, meaning that the fairing gently landed in the Pacific Ocean, rather than Mr. Steven\u2019s now-famous fairing recovery net. This is quite possibly the first time in aerospace history that an orbital rocket\u2019s payload fairing has been recovered\u00a0", "intact", ", and the fairing in question looks very much intact.", "As mentioned by Musk, that massive piece of hardware had to survive reentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere at no less than Mach 8, considerably more than two times faster than the famous SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. While the fairing\u2019s parafoil appears to have sunk after being quickly detached, careful observers will note three vertical bars at its three corners, almost certainly the points where that parafoil attaches to them and allows it to gently float down to the ocean surface.\u00a0 While not nearly as consequential as SpaceX\u2019s growing expertise with Falcon booster recovery and reuse, each fairing \u2013 made largely of carbon fiber composites \u2013 takes a huge amount of time and effort to complete, and cost upwards of $3 million each ($6m for both halves). In this sense, SpaceX has managed to recover a pallet of cash, as Musk humorously likened the effort fairing reuse to in 2017.", "Given just how good the fairing\u2019s condition appears to be, as well as the calm sea states, it\u2019s very likely that SpaceX will try to pick up the landed fairing with a crane, although that would require a different vessel \u2013 Mr. Steven has no crane!

Confirmed to have successfully deployed and begun communicating with SpaceX ground control, this is another huge accomplishment for SpaceX and marks their first-ever steps into dedicated satellite manufacturing and operation. Despite the significance of this event, SpaceX was keen to lower expectations for the satellite internet network, named Starlink. The following statement was provided during the webcast:", "For all intents and purposes, this appears to be a significant departure from previous statements given about Starlink by the rocket company. The explicit mention of \u201clow and moderate\u201d population densities being the only focus of service contrasts heavily with a general sense that Starlink was intended from the outset to provide universal internet around the globe to anyone who could afford the service. This certainly serves as a confirmation that there are major technological hurdles that will need to be overcome for Starlink to become the universal internet many have come to hope for from SpaceX \u2013 it would appear that it will be quite difficult to serve high-density populations with SpaceX\u2019s current choice of technologies for their constellation.", "Still, the demand is undeniably there. Even readers of Teslarati expressed an immediate desire to ditch their cable companies and ISPs, both in the US and abroad. If SpaceX can make it happen, they will have hordes of eager ISP-hating internet users desperate for any alternatives, and your author is proudly among them. The badly served aside, it sounds like SpaceX may be pivoting towards Starlink as a method of connecting the underserved \u2013 mainly those in rural or undeveloped areas. Even in the US, this is a major problem for those that do not live near large cities, and US ISPs are exceptionally anti-consumer in these situations \u2013 often times charging obscene costs for cable installation or outright refusing to provide coverage. Starlink could be a boon for those individuals in the US and elsewhere, especially where a simple lack of infrastructure is the cause. Much of Africa suffers from this, although mobile networks have become a backbone for a relatively unique pattern of mobile phone usage.", "Here\u2019s to hoping that SpaceX manages to once again rise to an exceptional technological challenge. As with all R&D efforts, the company\u2019s satellite effort would be helped immensely with additional funds, and thankfully Falcon 9 Block 5 is very nearly ready to fly its first missions. This highly reusable iteration of the rocket could enable SpaceX to fly dozens of missions with a single Falcon 9 booster, and would thus enable unprecedented profit margins for a launch company, at least in the interim. Eventually, SpaceX is bound to bring down its prices for the customer, but the first need to recoup their reusability and Falcon Heavy investments, while also ensuring a sound business plan to support the development of their BFR and BFS vehicles that may one day enable the colonization of space.

A truly massive steel structure, the TEL is tasked with carrying the rocket to the launch pad, typically a short quarter mile trek from the integration facility. Once it reaches the pad, the TEL uses a powerful hydraulic lift system to rotate itself and its rocket payload from horizontal to vertical. It may look underwhelming, but it serves to remember that a complete Falcon 9/Heavy and its TEL are both considerably more than twice as tall as a basketball court is long.", "Once at the pad, the TEL serves as the rocket\u2019s connection to the pad\u2019s ", "many different ground systems", ".

If the educated speculation above is, in fact, the truth of the matter, SpaceX can be expected to begin earnestly petitioning the local and state governments for additional public funds to partially support the major undertaking.

Stormy Atlantic seas, partially connected to the chaotic weather recently seen on the East coast, proved to be far too dangerous for SpaceX\u2019s eastern recovery fleet and its drone ship, OCISLY, and they returned to Port Canaveral around 48 hours ago, under the watchful eyes of many anxious SpaceX followers. Tragically, this means that the brand new Falcon 9 booster (B1044) \u2013 originally expected to attempt perhaps the most difficult landing yet \u2013 had to be expended. Although the booster went through its paces as if it were preparing to land, it found no drone ship beneath it once it reached sea level, and subsequently dunked into the stormy Atlantic seas.", "However, due to the last-minute nature of SpaceX and Hispasat\u2019s decision to expend the booster rather than delay for better recovery conditions, launch technicians at Pad 40 simply did not have time to remove the rocket\u2019s iconic landing legs and valuable titanium grid fins \u2013 the first time their titanium iteration has been chosen for a Falcon 9 to resist extreme reentry heating.

By igniting three of its nine Merlin 1D engines instead of the usual single engine while landing, Falcon boosters can theoretically reduce the amount of fuel needed to safely land, fuel savings that can then be used to push its payloads higher and faster. However, the downsides of this approach are several. With three times as many engines igniting at landing, the margin of error for a successful landing becomes downright miniscule \u2013 the tiniest of problems with ignition, throttle control, or guidance could cause the rocket to smash into the drone ship at considerable speed.

At a minimum, it will provide SpaceX\u2019s launch, design, and manufacturing experts a sort of base of knowledge about building and operating rockets with ~30 or more first stage engines \u2013 the 2017 iteration of BFR is likely to sport 31. It\u2019s also possible that Falcon Heavy could provide the margins necessary to allow SpaceX ", "to attempt recoveries of Falcon\u2019s second stage", ", a purely experimental effort that would feed directly into the development of the fully-reusable BFR upper stage the company hopes to build, BFS.", "Thus, while Falcon Heavy\u2019s inaugural launch may not be explicitly important to SpaceX\u2019s near-term business strategy, it will in almost every way mark one of its first tailor-made steps towards Mars, perhaps both literally and figuratively. Rather humorously, SpaceX ", "(or Elon Musk \u2026 probably just Elon Musk)", " has chosen to replace the boilerplate mass simulator often flown as a payload for inaugural launches of most launch vehicles (Falcon 9 included) with a rather unique mass simulator: Musk\u2019s own first-generation Tesla Roadster. While it has yet to be specified what the specific destination of the second stage and Roadster are, nor what \u2013 if any \u2013 functional payload is to be included, Musk did suggest that the destination would be a \u201cbillion-year Mars orbit.\u201d The nitpick here is hugely significant, as \u2018simply\u2019 launching the Roadster into a solar orbit at a similar distance to Mars\u00a0(still an impressive accomplishment) would be decidedly less impressive than actually injecting the Roadster into orbit\u00a0", "around", " Mars. Pictures released by SpaceX show no additional boost stages attached to the Roadster, so a Martian orbit would require Falcon Heavy\u2019s second stage to coast in deep space for several months while generating enough power to prevent its propellant from freezing and maintain contact with ground control, especially in the rather likely event that SpaceX (and Musk) hope to acquire some rather absurd and iconic images from the inaugural launch and its space travels.", "\u00a0", "History and symbolism aside, it can now be said with utter certainty that Falcon Heavy is very real and is likely to launch very soon. The vehicle\u2019s first-ever integrated rollout to Pad 39A is almost certainly intended only for \u201cfit-checks,\u201d a verification that the pad and brand new vehicle are meshing well together, but it is still the first time in the company\u2019s history that FH visibly exists, and there can be little doubt that the photo opportunity was not taken advantage of. After fit checks are performed, likely over the course of a day or two, Falcon Heavy will be most likely be brought horizontal and rolled back into 39A\u2019s integration facilities, where it will be prepared for its first full-up wet dress rehearsal (WDR) and static fire, possibly including the cautionary removal of the second stage and Roadster payload. Because the vehicle is inherently new, as are many of the upgraded ground systems needed to support it, bugs are highly probable along the road to launch. However, if the first WDR and static fire go precisely as planned, the first launch attempt can be expected to occur about a week later \u2013 maybe sooner, maybe later.", "All things considered, ", "SpaceX is clearly moving full speed ahead", " with Falcon Heavy\u2019s launch preparations, and it seems highly probable that the company\u2019s schedule will allow for January launch, even if minor issues mean that multiple WDRs or static fires are required. Elon Musk certainly hedged his bets earlier this summer by aggressively inflating the probability that Falcon Heavy fails on its launch pad, ", "famously stating", " that a success in his eyes would be the vehicle clearing the pad without destroying LC-39A. In reality, SpaceX would not in a million years haphazardly risk the destruction of Pad 39A, and the company is almost certainly quite confident that the pad is at most marginally at risk of severe damage. One thing that Musk cannot be criticized for is the argument that one way or another, Falcon Heavy\u2019s inaugural launch will be a sight to behold. While the payload may indeed be heading to or towards Mars, SpaceX still plans to attempt recovery of all three of Falcon Heavy\u2019s first stages: both side cores are expected to land almost simultaneously at LZ-1\u2019s two landing pads, while the center booster will follow a parabola out into the Atlantic for a landing aboard the droneship Of Course I Still Love You, truly a spectacle to behold regardless of success or failure.", "Follow along live on ", "Twitter ", "and ", "Instagram ", "as our launch photographer Tom Cross documents Falcon Heavy\u2019s last steps along its journey to first flight, as well as Falcon 9\u2019s imminent launch of the mysterious Zuma payload, currently NET January 4.", "Cover photo courtesy of spaceflight fan and photographer Richard Angle.

A rough analogy is that we are trying to build the equivalent of the transcontinental railway. A vast amount of industry will need to be built on Mars by many other companies and millions of people.", "Q:\u00a0Does your Mars city feature permanently anchored BFS spaceships?", "A (Elon):\u00a0Wouldn\u2019t read too much into that illustration", "Q:\u00a0Have any candidate landing sites for the Mars base been identified?", "A (Elon):\u00a0Landing site needs to be low altitude to maximize aero braking, be close to ice for propellant production and not have giant boulders. Closer to the equator is better too for solar power production and not freezing your ass off.", "Q:\u00a0Who will design and build the ISRU system for the propellant depot, and how far along is it?", "A (Elon):\u00a0SpaceX. Design is pretty far along. It\u2019s a key part of the whole system.", "Without ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), BFS\u00a0is unlikely to ever be able to take humans to Mars affordably enough to enable large colonies. This news is thus of huge importance, and suggests that SpaceX will be able to focus on developing BFR and BFS near-term.\u00a0", "Q: Will the BFS landing propellants have to be actively cooled on the long trip to Mars?", "A\u00a0(Elon): The main tanks will be vented to vacuum, the outside of the ship is well insulated (primarily for reentry heating) and the nose of the ship will be pointed mostly towards the sun, so very little heat is expected to reach the header tanks. That said, the propellant can be cooled either with a small amount of evaporation. Down the road, we might add a cryocooler.", "A\u00a0(Elon):\u00a0exactly (while methane could be kept in its liquid form solely through high pressure storage, the pressures required are immense and would require tanks that would be far too heavy for a rocket\u2019s second stage.", "Cold liquid oxygen and methane will unavoidably warm up over time, eventually returning to their gaseous forms if allowed.

It is quite small (and light) relative to the rest of the vehicle and is never actually used to generate lift in the way that an aircraft wing is used.", "Its true purpose is to \u201cbalance out\u201d the ship, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t enter engines first from orbit (that would be really bad), and provide pitch and yaw control during reentry.", "Q: Why is the 2017 BFS spaceship largely cylindrical?", "A\u00a0(Elon): Best mass ratio is achieved by not building a box in a box. The propellant tanks need to be cylindrical to be remotely mass efficient and they have to carry ascent load, so lowest mass solution is just to mount the heat shield plates directly to the tank wall.", "For a rocket,\u00a0", "mass ratio\u00a0", "refers to its weight with a full load of propellant divided by its weight while completely empty.

I think it\u2019s clear a craft doesn\u2019t need one for reentry, only for subsonic gliding, which BFS doesn\u2019t really do.)", "BFS doesn\u2019t need a tail because tails add weight, are\u00a0of little use during orbital reentry, and BFS is not intended to glide.\u00a0", "Q: Why was the number of BFS landing legs increased from 3 to 4?", "A\u00a0(Elon): Because 4", "A\u00a0(Elon):\u00a0Improves stability in rough terrain", "Q: How is the radiation shielding in the ITS?", "A (Elon):\u00a0Ambient radiation damage is not significant for our transit times.

Further refinement is likely.", "Header tanks refer to smaller tanks contained within the main propellant tanks that are used to ignite engines in microgravity. It\u2019s easier to pressurize or simply fill the smaller tanks than it is to do so with the massive main tanks.\u00a0", "Q: Will the BFS tanker\u2019s payload section be empty, or include extra propellant tanks?", "A\u00a0(Elon): At first, the tanker will just be a ship with no payload.

Thrust to weight of 1.3 will feel quite gentle. The tanker will only feel the 0.3 part, as gravity cancels out the 1.

Worth noting that BFS is capable of reaching orbit by itself with low payload, but having the BF Booster increases payload by more than an order of magnitude. Earth is the wrong planet for single stage to orbit. No problemo on Mars.", "The first real tests of the BFR will be done by hopping a full-scale BFS \u201cseveral hundred kilometers\u201d. BFS is capable of launching itself and a tiny payload into orbit, but the utility is limited on Earth. On Mars, BFS will be far more capable as a single stage to orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Q: Why was Raptor thrust reduced from ~300 tons-force to ~170 tons-force?", "A (Elon): We chickened out. The engine thrust dropped roughly in proportion to the vehicle mass reduction from the first IAC talk. In order to be able to land the BF Ship with an engine failure at the worst possible moment, you have to have multiple engines. The difficulty of deep throttling an engine increases in a non-linear way, so 2:1 is fairly easy, but a deep 5:1 is very hard. Granularity is also a big factor. If you just have two engines that do everything, the engine complexity is much higher and, if one fails, you\u2019ve lost half your power. Btw, we modified the BFS design since IAC to add a third medium area ratio Raptor engine partly for that reason (lose only 1/3 thrust in engine out) and allow landings with higher payload mass for the Earth to Earth transport function.", "The Raptor engine\u2019s maximum thrust has been decreased mainly because the size of the rocket decreased, from 12m to 9m in diameter. For redundancy\u2019s sake, SpaceX has added a third central engine to the spaceship, versus the two engines mentioned at the 2017 IAC.\u00a0", "Q: Will the BFR autogenous pressurization system be heat exchanger based?", "A\u00a0(Elon): We plan to use the Incendio spell from Harry Potter", "A\u00a0(Elon): But, yes and probably", "Autogenous pressurization\u00a0", "refers to the method of propellant tank pressurization used. In microgravity conditions, tanks must be pressurized to keep fuel flowing to the engines and to improve the density of the fuel. While Falcon 9 currently uses high-pressure helium, ITS and now BFR have been designed to use the actual propellant in their tanks (methane and oxygen) for pressurization. This reduces the number of failure modes on BFR and improves the spaceship\u2019s payload capabilities.", "Q: Will the BFS methalox control thrusters be derived from Raptor or from SuperDraco engines?", "A\u00a0(Elon): The control thrusters will be closer in design to the Raptor main chamber than SuperDraco and will be pressure-fed to enable lowest possible impulse bit (no turbopump spin delay).", "Like Falcon 9, BFR will need gas thrusters (RCS, reaction control system) to control its orientation (and refuel) while in microgravity conditions. While Falcon uses cold nitrogen gas thrusters, BFR will utilize the propellant it is already carrying for Raptor, methane and oxygen. Again, the goal of this is to reduce complexity.\u00a0", "Q: Could you update us on the status of scaling up the Raptor prototype to the final size?", "A\u00a0(Elon): Thrust scaling is the easy part. Very simple to scale the dev Raptor to 170 tons.", "The flight engine design is much lighter and tighter, and is extremely focused on reliability. The objective is to meet or exceed passenger airline levels of safety. If our engine is even close to a jet engine in reliability, has a flak shield to protect against a rapid unscheduled disassembly and we have more engines than the typical two of most airliners, then exceeding airline safety should be possible.", "That will be especially important for point to point journeys on Earth. The advantage of getting somewhere in 30 mins by rocket instead of 15 hours by plane will be negatively affected if \u201cbut also, you might die\u201d is on the ticket.", "SpaceX\u2019s subscale Raptor, the one seen in videos and photos of it firing, is understood to be a bit more than half the size of the operational engine described at IAC 2017. Increasing the scale of the engine is not the difficult aspect of development. Rather, optimization, weight reduction, and extreme reusability are the main sources of difficulty needed before Raptor is flight-ready. This reusability is central to the goal of reliable and rapid reuse of orbital-class rockets.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Q:\u00a0Can BFS vacuum-Raptors be fired at sea level pressure?", "A:\u00a0The \u201cvacuum\u201d or high area ratio Raptors can operate at full thrust at sea level. Not recommended.", "Put simply, vacuum nozzles do not like to operate in an atmosphere.", "Q: Does SpaceX have any interest in putting more satellites in orbit around Mars (or even rockets) for internet/communications before we get feet on the ground? Or are the current 5-6 active ones we have there sufficient?", "A\u00a0(Elon): Yes", "Q: Also will there be some form of an internet or communications link with Earth? Is SpaceX going to be in charge of putting this in or are you contracting some other companies?", "A\u00a0(Elon): If anyone wants to build a high bandwidth comm link to Mars, please do.", "Taken side by side, this likely indicates that SpaceX will develop a high-bandwidth Mars-Earth communications link if nobody else does, but that they would logical prefer that someone else builds that infrastructure beforehand.", "Q: The concept of an internet connection on Mars is kinda awesome. You could theoretically make an internet protocol that would mirror a subset of the internet near Mars. A user would need to queue up the parts of the internet they wanted available and the servers would sync the relevant data.", "A\u00a0(Elon): Nerd", "A\u00a0(Elon): But, yes, it would make sense to strip the headers out and do a UDP-style feed with extreme compression and a CRC check to confirm the packet is good, then do a batch resend of the CRC-failed packets. Something like that. Earth to Mars is over 22 light-minutes at max distance.", "A\u00a0(Elon): 3 light-minutes at closest distance. So you could Snapchat, I suppose. If that\u2019s a thing in the future.", "The communication delay between Earth and Mars (at least several minutes one-way) will prevent any Martian habitats from simply integrating with Earth\u2019s Internet. The delay will require some sort of mediation. As an example, a user\u00a0on Mars could select the websites they want to browse or videos they want to watch beforehand, and they would be available between several minutes and an hour later.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Q: Boring question about Mars:", "A (Elon): More boring!", "\u00a0", "Q: This is one bizarre AMA so far\u2026", "A (Elon): Just wait\u2026", "Q: i feel like thats a threat. \u201cjust wait. it will get way more bizarre than that. let me finish my whiskey\u201d", "A (Elon): How did you know?

Esoteric model numbers aside, this simply means that Falcon 9\u2019s design, manufacture, and operation are all maturing rapidly; SpaceX has clearly learned from the CRS-7 and Amos-6 failures and responded accordingly with a more cautious and tempered perspective.", "From a historical perspective, it is extraordinarily impressive that Falcon 9 and Cargo Dragon have experienced such a tiny number of failures over their short but active existences. Both Falcon 9 and Dragon have experienced several miscellaneous teething issues and technical difficulties over their ~7 years of launches, but only three anomalies resulted in failures that catastrophically impacted customer payloads:\u00a0CRS-1, CRS-7, and Amos-6.

To put it more simply, SpaceX is a business that must balance costs and returns, while Blue Origin is funded exclusively out of billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 pocket.", "As a result of being completely privately funded, Bezos\u2019 deep pockets could render Blue more flexible than SpaceX when pricing launches. If Blue chooses to aggressively price New Glenn by accounting for booster reusability, it could pose a threat to SpaceX\u2019s own business strategy. If SpaceX is unable to recoup its investment in reusability before New Glenn is regularly conducting multiple commercial missions per year, likely no earlier than 2021 or 2022, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 pricing could be rendered distinctly noncompetitive.", "However, this concern seems almost entirely misplaced. SpaceX has half a decade of experience mass-producing orbital-class (reusable) rockets, (reusable) fairings, and propulsion systems, whereas Blue Origin at best has minimal experience manufacturing a handful of suborbital vehicles over a period of a few years. Blue has a respectable amount of experience with their BE-3 hydrolox propulsion system, and that will likely transfer over to the BE-3U vacuum variant to be used for New Glenn\u2019s third stage. The large methalox rocket engine (BE-4) that will power New Glenn\u2019s first stage also conducted its first-ever hot-fire\u00a0just weeks ago, a major milestone in propulsion development but also a reminder that BE-4 has an exhaustive regime of engineering verification and flight qualification testing ahead of it.", "Perhaps more importantly, the company\u2019s relative success with New Shepard\u2019s launch, recovery, and reuse has not and cannot move beyond small suborbital hops, and thus cannot provide the experience at the level of orbital rocketry. New Shepard is admittedly capable of reaching an altitude of 100km, ", "but the suborbital vehicle\u2019s flight regime does not require it to travel beyond Mach 4 (~1300 m/s)", ". The first stage of Falcon 9, however, is approximately four times as tall and three times the mass of New Shepard, and boosters attempting recovery during geostationary missions routinely reach ", "almost twice the velocity", " of New Shepard, entering the thicker atmosphere at more than 2300 m/s (1500-1800 m/s for LEO missions). Falcon 9\u2019s larger mass and velocity translates into intense reentry heating and aerodynamic forces, best demonstrated by the glowing aluminum grid fins that can often be seen in SpaceX\u2019s live coverage of booster recovery. Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn concept is extremely impressive on paper, but the company will have to pull off an extraordinary leap of technological maturation to move directly from suborbital single-stage hops to multi-stage orbital rocketry. Blue\u2019s accomplishments with New Shepard are nothing to scoff at, but they are a far cry from routine orbital launch services.", "Translating back to the new establishment, Falcon 9 will likely remain SpaceX\u2019s workhorse rocket for some five or more years, at least until BFR can prove itself to be a reliable and affordable replacement. This change in focus, combined with the downsides of second stage recovery and reuse on a Falcon 9-sized vehicle, means that SpaceX will \u2018only\u2019 end up operationally reusing first stages and fairings from the vehicle. The second stage accounts for approximately 20-30% of Falcon 9\u2019s total cost, suggesting that rapid and complete reuse of the fairing and first stage could more than halve its ~$62 million price. Yet this too ignores another mundane fact of corporate life SpaceX must face. Its executives, Musk included, ", "have lately expressed a desire", " to at least partially recoup the ~$1 billion that was invested to develop reuse. Assuming a partial 10% reduction in cost to reuse customers and profit margins of 50% with rapid and total reuse of the first stage and fairing, 20 to 30 commercial reuses would recoup most or all of SpaceX\u2019s reusability investment.", "Musk recently revealed that SpaceX is aiming to complete 30 launches in 2018, and that figure will likely continue to grow in 2019, assuming no major anomalies occur. Manufacturing will rapidly become the main choke point for increased launch cadence, suggesting that drastically higher cadences will largely depend upon first stage reuse with minimal refurbishment, which just so happens to be the goal of the Falcon 9\u2019s upcoming Block 5 iteration. Even if the modifications only manage a handful of launches without refurbishment, rather than the ten flights being pursued, each additional flight without maintenance will effectively multiply SpaceX\u2019s manufacturing capabilities. More bluntly: ten Falcon 9s\u00a0 capable of five reflights could do the same job of 50 brand new rockets with 1/5th of the manufacturing backend.", "\u00a0", "Assuming that upcoming reuses proceed without significant failures and Falcon 9 Block 5 subsumes all manufacturing sometime in 2018 or 2019, it is entirely possible that SpaceX will undergo an extraordinarily rapid phase change from expendability to reusability. Mirroring 2017, we can imagine that SpaceX\u2019s Hawthorne factory will continue to churn out at least 10 to 20 Block 5 Falcon 9s over the course of 2018. Assuming 5 to 10 maintenance-free reuses and a lifespan of as many as 100 flights with intermittent refurb, a single year of manufacturing could provide SpaceX with enough first stages to launch anywhere from ", "50 to 2000 missions.\u00a0", "The reality will inevitably find itself somewhere between those extremely pessimistic and optimistic bookends, and they of course do not account for fairings, second stages, or expendable flights.", "If we assume that the proportional cost of Falcon 9\u2019s many components\u00a0", "very roughly", " approximates the amount of manufacturing backend needed to produce them, downsizing Falcon 9 booster production by a factor of two or more could free a huge fraction of SpaceX\u2019s workforce and floor space to be repurposed for fairing and second stage production, as well as the company\u2019s Mars efforts. Such a phase change would also free up a considerable fraction of the capital SpaceX continually invests in its manufacturing infrastructure and workforce, capital that could then be used to ready SpaceX\u2019s facilities for production and testing of its Mars-focused BFR and BFS.", "It cannot be overstated that ", "the speculation in this article ", "is speculation", ". ", "Nevertheless, it is speculation built on real information provided over the years by SpaceX\u2019s own executives. Rough estimates like this offer a glimpse into a new launch industry paradigm that could be only a year or two away and could allow SpaceX to begin aggressively pursuing its goal of enabling a sustainable human presence on Mars and throughout the Solar System.", "Blue Origin\u2019s future endeavors shine on paper and their goal of enabling millions to work and live space are admirable, but the years between the present and a future of routine orbital missions for the company may not be kind. The engineering hurdles that litter the path to orbital rocketry are unforgiving and can only be exacerbated by blind overconfidence, a lesson that is often only learned the hard way. Blue Origin\u2019s proud motto \u201cGradatim ferociter\u201d roughly translates to \u201cStep by step, ferociously.\u201d One can only hope that some level of humility and sobriety might temper that ferocity before customers entrust New Glenn with their infrastructural foundations\u00a0and passengers entrust New Shepard with their lives."]},

Nuclear-powered methods of propulsion have the potential to drastically increase the efficiency of spacecraft once in orbit, with the primary benefit being faster travel times around the Solar System. Faster transit times for manned spacecraft would translate into fewer consumables needed for those journeys, increasing the amount of other supplies that could be brought in a single trip. Beyond the orbit of Mars, other destinations humans might like to visit will require non-chemical propulsion, with more traditional rocketry leading to one-way voyages measured in years.", "Equally exciting, she\u00a0stated that SpaceX\u00a0plans\u00a0to attempt the first soft landing of Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage before the end of 2018. Second stage recovery efforts would proceed much like Falcon 9\u2019s first stage recovery did, beginning with attempts to land softly in the ocean and later bring in a droneship to attempt legitimate recoveries of the vehicle. While SpaceX\u2019s now highly successful program of first stage recovery has taken the first steps to appreciably lower the cost of access to orbit, as much as 30% or more of the cost of every Falcon 9 launch can be found in the second stage and its many components, all of which are currently discarded every launch. Second stage recovery and reuse is nevertheless absolutely crucial to SpaceX\u2019s and Elon Musk\u2019s goal of reducing launch costs by anywhere from a factor of 10 to 100.", "Still, the payload fairing \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0major component of the Falcon 9 \u2013\u00a0", "costs approximately $5 million", " on its own, nearly 10% of the cost of a $62 million expendable launch. SpaceX has been making concerted progress towards fairing recovery and reuse, and Musk has said that he expects SpaceX to accomplish the first successful fairing recoveries before the end of 2017. The second stage is thus the obvious next step if the goal is to create a fully-reusable Falcon 9. SpaceX, however, seem to be prioritizing a different path.", "Shotwell clarified that SpaceX would not attempt to reuse Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage, even if recovery efforts succeed. This\u00a0suggests\u00a0that SpaceX is planning to focus the majority of its research and development staff and capital on their considerably larger \u201cBFR (Big Falcon Rocket) planetary colonizer\u201d vehicle, which\u00a0will be unveiled for the first time later today. Hence, Shotwell\u2019s comment lends confidence to the belief that Falcon 9 will never become fully reusable, which makes sense. The decision to focus energy on a new launch vehicle is arguably a more efficient and productive task than modifying Falcon 9 even more drastically. The development of an entirely\u00a0new rocket\u00a0offers SpaceX the freedom to design for\u00a0complete reusability from the start, whereas Falcon 9\u2019s path to partial reusability has been inevitably circuitous.", "Finally, Shotwell briefly discussed SpaceX\u2019s\u00a0desire ", "to create a vast constellation of Internet satellites", " around Earth, stating that their goal was \u201cmake scads of cash, spend it going to Mars, [and] give Mars broadband too!\u201d.

These rules require that communication satellites operating in non-geostationary orbits (NGSO) share the available wireless spectrum equally among themselves when two or more satellites pass within a certain distance of each other relative to ground stations. In simpler terms, consider your smartphone\u2019s cellular connectivity. The FCC\u2019s rule for satellites in lower orbits can be thought of like multiple smartphones using the same cell tower to access the internet: the cell tower simply acknowledges the multiple devices it needs to serve and allows each device a certain amount of bandwidth.", "However, the FCC is admittedly a domestic Commission focused on administering communications rules and regulations in the United States, and an agency already exists for coordinating global communications needs, called the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The ITU\u2019s Radio Regulations are considerably more simplistic. Rather than the FCC\u2019s more nuanced and reasonable methods of spectrum sharing, the ITU allows the first satellite operator actively using a certain orbit or spectrum to become the primary coordinator for all interference issues. Put more simply, it gives those who launch communications satellites first a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d advantage that lets those entities then set the rules for interference with their constellation.", "Both OneWeb and Telesat, companies also interested in launching global broadband constellations, are licensed in countries other than the United States, meaning that the FCC has given the ITU precedent in deciding how to deal with SpaceX\u2019s potential constellation interference. SpaceX\u2019s proposed constellation of at least ", "several thousand satellites", " ends up being at a distinct disadvantage simply because it would take far longer for SpaceX to even partially complete its constellation when compared with competitors like OneWeb, who expect to finish launching the first phase of their constellation several hundred satellites by the end of 2020. Under the ITU\u2019s regulations, SpaceX could be forced by competitors to effectively step on eggshells around their constellations by avoiding interference to the furthest extent possible, rather than simply sharing spectrum in the brief periods where different satellites temporarily interfere with each other.", "While the FCC\u2019s choice to cede international interference coordination to the ITU is a huge blow to SpaceX\u2019s proposed internet constellation efforts, the same September 7th report also eased a handful of other requirements that would have proven difficult for SpaceX\u2019s massive constellation. For geostationary constellations, the FCC previously required that all satellites be launched within a period of six years, with failure to do so resulting in a revoked license for the company in question. In a small concession to SES, O3b, and SpaceX, the FCC now plans to require that 50% of lower orbit satellite constellations be launched within six years of receiving an FCC license. This would still be a massive challenge for SpaceX\u2019s plan of 4,425 initial satellites and a follow-up constellation ", "of more than 7,000 additional satellites (PDF download)", ".", "The FCC\u2019s September 7th report", " will not become final unless it is passed by vote ", "in a September 26th Open Commission Meeting", ". It is possible that SpaceX council will make a statement protesting the FCC\u2019s decision, but it is nevertheless likely that the FCC\u2019s report will be accepted and become official. While the LEO internet constellation has remained a low priority for SpaceX since it was revealed in 2015, the company has steadily continued work on the project and SpaceX has every reason to continue pursuing it given the potential profit margins it could produce.

Incredibly, Musk said that he and the company believe it will be possible to fund this development by replacing its current launch vehicles, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon, thus freeing up the development capital directed at those vehicles for BFR.

Raptor, the powerful methane-oxygen rocket engine intended to be the workhorse for any larger launch vehicle, has conducted dozens (42, to be specific) of successful hot fires at SpaceX\u2019s McGregor, Texas testing facilities. These ranged from a handful of seconds all the way to 100 seconds in duration, and Musk made it explicitly clear that the only limiting factor to test duration was the size of the tanks of propellant available to fuel the engine. Of crucial importance is the fact that the engine being tested in Texas is a subscale prototype, and is not representative of the final engine. However, SpaceX has since shrunk the final target for operational Raptors, and this means that the current scale is not far off from the final thrust figure. The prototype Raptor is believed to have a thrust of ", "approximately 1,000 kN", " (Kilonewtons), with slides from Musk\u2019s 2017 presentation pointing to a full scale thrust of 1700 kN, far closer to becoming real than the 3,000 kN figure ", "given at the 2016 IAC", ".", "Possibly even more significant is the reported success SpaceX has had with the construction and stress testing of a full-scale carbon fiber liquid oxygen tank, which was tested to a very eventful destruction on Washington state\u2019s Puget Sound. Fans closely followed this series of tests, but information was scarce and the general consensus was that the tank had failed unintentionally during those tests. The fact that Musk claimed that the 12 meter diameter tank was \u201csuccessfully tested\u201d at high pressures, as well as the confidence he expressed about a uniquely capable \u201ccarbon fiber matrix\u201d, suggest that SpaceX have leaped over one of biggest potential hurdles of their larger vehicle plans. Carbon fiber propellant tanks have the potential to make rockets significantly lighter and thus more efficient, particularly if no internal liner of metal is needed to ensure the safety of those carbon fiber tanks. One might remember the difficulties SpaceX had with supercool liquid oxygen, culminating in the Amos-6 mishap that saw carbon fiber helium tanks clash with SpaceX\u2019s then-new supercooled propellant procedures.", "Through many\u00a0challenging mistakes, SpaceX has learned the hard way that extra care must be taken when mixing carbon fiber and liquid oxygen. The telltale sign that SpaceX has, however, successfully learned from those mistakes can be found in the company\u2019s aspiration to begin construction of the first BFR cargo ship as early as April of 2018, barely six months from today. Time will tell if they can maintain that aggressive schedule and launch two Mars-bound cargo ships in 2022.

Ultimately, the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Soviet space programs invalidated a great deal of criticism and doubt while simultaneously demonstrating space exploration\u2019s ability to capture the attention of a great many people, albeit under the iron curtain of the Cold War. Even if these programs and their subsequent accomplishments occurred not out of the desire to explore and discover but rather as a means to demonstrate the superiority of a political and economic ideology, it was nevertheless an awe-inspiring period for human exploration, technological development, and scientific inquiry.", "Jump approximately half a century forward after Apollo 17 and one will find that the state of astronautics and space exploration are truly difficult to believe, in a sense of both intense disappointment and esteem. The impact of the United States Congress\u2019 complete and utter failure to properly take advantage of the technology developed over the course of the Apollo Program is ever so painfully evident to this day, having led to a series of connected missteps over the course of NASA\u2019s existence. The premature cancellation of the Apollo Program and complete dismissal of the Saturn family of rockets resulted in a five-year period wherein the U.S. was incapable of launching its own astronauts. This event marked the beginning of an apparent trend that saw itself repeated following the shuttering of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011\u200a\u2014\u200athe development of which led to the premature retirement of the Saturn family of rockets\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to free up NASA\u2019s budget to inexplicably allow for the development of another series of rockets as part of President Bush Jr.\u2019s Constellation Program, which later found itself cancelled (for good reason) and again largely revived with the present Space Launch System.", "Upon further examination of the Apollo, Space Shuttle, Constellation, and SLS programs, some rather disturbing realities set in. Following the cancellation of Apollo, Congress, the President, the Air Force, and the Department of Defense in general all had significant interest in the pursuance of much more affordable and rapid access to space by way of reusability, something that they all viewed was best achieved by way of a space plane. Each party had their own explicit and varied concepts for what that space plane might look like, and the Air Force, Department of Defense, and NASA were all engaged in scaled studies of demonstrators. To simplify a complex series of events, Congress and President Nixon ultimately decided that there should only be one spaceplane developed, and that that singular vehicle would be required to satisfy the goals of all parties to the greatest extent possible in order to allow its development to tap into the Department of Defense\u2019s budgetary surplus. Furthermore, in order to satisfy the Senators and Congresspeople central to the development of the Apollo Program hardware, NASA was required to make use of all presently existing facilities, hardware, and expertise in their efforts to design and develop what would eventually become the Space Shuttle. As a consequence of this, the Space Shuttle was in no way an optimal design, as it first and foremost was the innate result of political and bureaucratic compromise on a vast scale. In fact, at least one of the two complete failures of the Shuttle (making it the deadliest spacecraft to have ever flown) can in large part be linked directly to one of those compromises, namely the general requirement that the Shuttle be ", "completely ", "reusable, resulting in the use of an exceptionally fragile (it could be broken by falling foam from the Shuttle\u2019s external fuel tank) and complex thermal protection system being flown.", "The Constellation Program, enacted by President Bush Jr. and pursued from 2005 to 2009, was even worse off. More or less the political pet project of a Presidential administration in their final term, Constellation was intended to take humans back to the Moon and eventually to Mars, and entailed the development of a super heavy launch vehicle and smaller launch vehicle for crews. Both of these were required to make use of Shuttle hardware and research, thus paving the road for the Space Launch System (SLS) that was to follow after Constellation was cancelled, largely due to massive budget overruns, gross safety concerns, and a NASA budget that was many times too small to support such ventures on a reasonable timescale. Arising from the grave of Constellation, the Obama administration\u2019s Space Launch System and #JourneyToMars campaign began in earnest. Examined now, it is clear that all SLS learned from the failure of the Constellation Program was a strategy of legal obfuscation and legislated requirements of non-transparency, thus making the SLS Program extraordinarily difficult to characterize or cancel. Of course, the hints of commercial lobbyist fingers pulling strings can be easily observed, given that both Constellation and SLS heavily rely upon Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital-ATK, and Aerojet-Rocketdyne; as well as the fact that the districts of the legislative members of space-related committees featured in Congress and the Senate tend to host large manufacturing and testing facilities developed by NASA and the commercial entities listed above. A mere coincidence this is not.", "Nevertheless, the subject of commercial involvement in NASA and aerospace endeavors in general brings me to a more positive topic: the modern renaissance being experienced throughout the aerospace industry. While incredible things are being done with satellite miniaturization among other things, my main focus lies upon Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, more commonly known as SpaceX. Founded by the same individual who co-founded Tesla Motors, popularized a vacuum train concept known as the Hyperloop, and created Paypal, SpaceX has from the outset operated towards a single goal of colonizing Mars in order to better ensure the survival of humanity, while also inherently disrupting the aerospace industry (which was at the time ruled by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, later to become the United Launch Alliance monopoly). One could argue that they have thoroughly accomplished the latter goal, as SpaceX currently offers the most affordable launch prices (by a factor of two or more in the U.S.) and is also relentlessly pursuing a strategy of reusability in order to make their launch pricing magnitudes more affordable. Furthermore, SpaceX developed their second launch vehicle and orbital capsule, Falcon and Dragon, so fast and so efficiently that an optimistic NASA-produced estimate of development cost was more than 10 times higher than the reality. Nevertheless, there have been missteps along the way. SpaceX\u2019s recent on-pad failure, captured in a dramatic and highly popularized video, has not been easy and simply demonstrates the inherent difficulties and risks that must be faced when attempting to push the margins with something as sensitive as spaceflight. This is thankfully accepted by the industries who rely upon access to space, and thus SpaceX\u2019s many customers have responded pragmatically, and SpaceX has been treating this failure as another method of examining their vehicle in detail in order to better understand potential routes of failure and consequently ensure that they have the safest possible vehicle to conduct their initial upcoming manned launches.", "Most importantly, this mishap has clearly failed to dampen SpaceX\u2019s goal of creating a colony on Mars. In late September 2016, after more than a year and a half of anticipation in the aerospace community, ", "Elon Musk took to the main stage of the International Aeronautical Conference", " and revealed the spacecraft and launch vehicle that SpaceX intends to use to construct a vast, self-sustaining colony on Mars. Deemed the Interplanetary Transport System, it hopes to exploit complete reusability and the benefits of mass production already demonstrated with the Falcon 9 in order to decrease the cost of trip to Mars by five million percent, thus optimistically opening the figurative gates to Mars by offering a ticket price equivalent to a modern luxury car or averagely priced house ($100,000 to $500,000). The shock value alone is enough to sow doubt in many. The combined spaceship and booster will stand 10 meters taller and 2 meters wider than Saturn V, the currently largest rocket to have ever flown successfully. Used in an expendable configuration, it would be capable of lofting more than four times the payload of Saturn V (550 metric tons), and up to 300 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit while operating as a fully reusable system. The entire system will have a liftoff mass of 10,500 metric tons and produce 13,000 metric tons of thrust, both nearly four times as much as Saturn V. Framed in a fittingly staggering manner, the ITS booster at launch would momentarily produce as much power as the entire grid of the United States produces on average, 500 gigawatts.", "Seated in the audience of the Guadalajara Expo events room, I will admit that even I was quite skeptical. If successful, SpaceX would be leaping ahead of all competition and truly opening space to the masses, while also completely upsetting current accepted norms of what can be done in space. For perspective, the downright vast International Space Station, constructed over the course of more than a decade with more than 100 launches required at a cost of possibly $100 billion or more, masses in at about 430 metric tons. A single ITS ship could theoretically loft that mass and then some in a single launch, and at a cost of approximately $250 million. While of course that is an unfair comparison, it is still fair to judge the cost of the ISS almost entirely as a reflection of the launch costs, given that the 36 Shuttle launches it required cost NASA at least $50 billion, with the reasonable assumption that each STS launch was around $1.5 billion. Continuing on, SpaceX\u2019s timescale noted that the ITS structure and propulsion systems are expected to be completed by the end of 2018, with complete ITS ship and booster test articles entering test phases in mid-2018 and early 2019 respectively. In this theoretical (and admittedly optimistic) schedule, cargo flights to Mars would begin in 2022, and the first ITS with passengers would depart for Mars in late 2024 (approximately 8 years from today) for a landing in early 2025. The next likeliest \u201ccompetitor\u201d, NASA, has no public schedule or plan whatsoever for their \u201c#JourneyToMars\u201d and have at best hinted at manned missions beginning in the late 2030s or early 2040s, although such an accomplishment would require massive budget increases for the agency. SpaceX\u2019s claims are truly extraordinary in their audaciousness. Their ultimate goal in creating this rocket and vehicle are to eventually allow for the creation of a self-sustaining colony of hundreds of thousands of people on Mars, an outpost that would optimistically act as a fail-safe for humanity in the event of a global catastrophe on Earth. They hope to make this possible by lowering the ticket price per individual to something under $200,000, or much lower than the average price of a single family home in the United States.", "Yet still, two major features of the presentation allayed the majority of my skepticism: not only has the company completed an ITS engine test article and begun to test fire it, they have also completed a full scale carbon composite propellant tank for the spaceship and successfully put it through an initial series of tests. Examined as a technological system, these two aspects are arguably the biggest hurdles for the ITS to solve, as neither technology has ever flown successfully. These successful hardware demonstrations act as a massive source of optimism for SpaceX\u2019s bold goals and timeline, as the breadth of their present-day accomplishments nearly match the sheer boldness of their ambitions. Furthermore, Elon Musk\u2019s incredible desire to make this happen encourages even more optimism when regarding the financing of the development of the ITS, as he has a track record of putting every last penny of his liquid assets into his projects, up to the last day he expects to be able to fund them (evidenced by Tesla and SpaceX). He is now worth upwards of $10 billion and could undoubtedly fund the development of the ITS himself, in the unlikelihood of interested third-party investors.", "I was lucky enough to experience this extraordinary keynote in person, and even luckier to have had my group recognized by SpaceX and the congress organizers and been given reserved seating near the front row, alongside heads of state, agencies, and commercial aerospace behemoths, not to mention astronautical celebrities like Buzz Aldrin. I was also able to attend dozens of other technical talks, many focused on current robotic exploration of Mars, as well as research into closed habitats intended to allow humans to live comfortably away from Earth while also producing a large percentage of the food they would need. The researcher presenting on habitats also revealed that SpaceX had already approached his group and another.", "All told, the 2016 International Astronautical Congress offered a cautiously optimistic view of the future of spaceflight. Elon Musk ended his keynote on the ITS by emphasizing that SpaceX wanted to encourage other companies to begin developing the systems necessary for humans to comfortably journey to and thrive on Mars. SpaceX has no interest in creating a monopoly, the company\u2019s singular desire is to more effectively ensure the survival of humanity, and as Musk said himself, to encourage people to do things that make them excited to get out of bed in the morning. More than ever before, I am nearly certain that I will find my way to Mars well within my lifetime, and I have never been more thrilled to be alive.", "Written a handful of months after the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) was revealed last year, and a similar number of months after the trying loss of Amos-6, the new year has been undoubtedly kind to SpaceX.

Bringing with it more than\u00a05,000 pounds of food, water, scientific experiments, and technology demonstrations, the company\u2019s eleventh mission under their first Commercial Resupply Services contract is exceptional for a very unique and specific reason: the vehicle has flown\u00a0before, ", "bringing cargo to the ISS on SpaceX\u2019s fourth CRS mission to the ISS", ". This accomplishment makes the Dragon currently\u00a0docked at the ISS the only commercial spacecraft in human history to be launched into orbit more than once, continuing a tradition of auspicious firsts.", "Slightly more than two months after ", "the first ever successful reuse of an orbital-class rocket", ", SpaceX now has two extraordinary\u00a0demonstrations of success in favor of\u00a0the company\u2019s pursuit of democratizing\u00a0affordable access to space. Reusability is and has been SpaceX\u2019s method of pursuing that goal for at least a decade, with Musk publicly exhorting the potential benefits of rapid and complete reusability\u00a0", "as early as 2007", ". It is almost a running joke within the community of aerospace and SpaceX fans that Musk will compare commercial airlines to orbital launch services at least once every time he is interviewed, but his point is and has long been clear. If all one has to do to run a transportation service is refuel after every trip, the price of a ticket or cargo transport drastically decreases. While many have slyly laughed or dismissed this goal in the past, often using the Space Shuttle as an example of the futility of reusability as a tool for cost reduction, it is quite hard to deny what SpaceX has accomplished so far.", "The reuse of a Cargo Dragon is also arguably far more significant than it may initially appear. SpaceX has not provided any concrete information on the process of refurbishing the capsule, and it is entirely unclear if the \u201creuse\u201d entailed much more than furnishing\u00a0the CRS-4 pressure vessel and Draco thrusters with a new trunk, solar array, external shell. It is possible that, just like SES-10, the process of refurbishing a spacecraft for the first time resulted in little to no cost savings, and that this refurbishment took anywhere from several months to more than a year, with the CRS-4 capsule returning from orbit in late 2014. However, given the absolute rarity of reused capsule-type spacecraft, the data that engineers likely gathered throughout the process of refurbishing the Dragon would arguably make the whole process worthwhile even in the worst case scenarios described above. Hans Koenigsmann, Vice President of Mission Assurance at SpaceX, also noted ", "in a press conference following CRS-11\u2019s launch", " that the refurbishment of the capsule was somewhat uneventful, stating that the CRS-4 capsule had no unanticipated damage from the rigors of reentry and ocean landing and that SpaceX was already ready to consider using the capsule a third time.\u00a0It\u2019s likely that SpaceX ", "will begin to rely more heavily on Cargo Dragon reuse", " as they refocus a\u00a0majority of their manufacturing efforts on Dragon 2.", "SpaceX and Musk\u2019s (in)famous ultimate ambitions are to make humanity a multiplanterary species, partly as a way to combat the extinction risks that an asteroid or comet strike\u00a0pose, and partly because it is simply a staggering challenge that has the potential ", "to make many humans\u00a0\u201cexcited to wake up in the morning\u201d", ". In order to make this happen, Musk saw that access to orbit was far too expensive for a colony on another planet to ever be sustainable, and that resuability was the only immediately obvious and accessible method through which the price to orbit could be decreased by several magnitudes. SpaceX is now almost routinely recovering Falcon 9 first stages when the mass of the payload allows it, and with\u00a0", "a fifth and final version or \u201cBlock\u201d of the vehicle", "\u00a0optimized for rapid reuse set to debut later this year, Musk and others at the company have begun ruminating once more about the possibility of recovering and reusing the second stage of the Falcon 9. Benchmarked somewhere around 30% of the price of the vehicle, routine loss of the second stage effectively prevents the price of the Falcon 9 from dropping much below $20-30 million US dollars. While a nearly 50% or greater reduction in price would be an exceptional accomplishment, it is still far from from the multiple orders of magnitude reduction Musk hoped for when he set out to develop reusable rocketry.", "This is where the reuse of Dragon pops its head up. With second stage recovery now being considered theoretically and Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon) preparing to begin regular launches in either Q4 2017 or Q1 2018, SpaceX has a good deal of experience to gain from learning how to safely and rapidly recover and reuse vehicles reentering the atmosphere at orbital velocity. Compared to recovering the first stage, this is another endeavor entirely. The fastest speed at which a recoverable first stage can\u00a0ever realistically reenter the atmosphere ", "is currently capped at around 5200 mph (2300 m/s), and is usually much closer to 3000 mph", ". An orbital capsule like Dragon, however, enters the atmosphere from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at around five\u00a0times that speed, typically close to 16,000 mph. In the context of recovering the second stage of Falcon 9, one must consider that most of SpaceX\u2019s commercial manifest is made up of geostationary satellites, which require more energy to reach a higher orbit, and consequently would require the second stage to survive even higher reentry velocities in order to be recovered.", "Returning from Mars, as SpaceX\u2019s Interplanetary Transport System would have to, results in even higher reentry velocities of at least 25,000 mph for a reasonably quick journey. This is the most important detail in explaining the true value of simply reusing a Dragon capsule as SpaceX has just now done. By taking its first steps towards routinely reusing truly orbital spacecraft, SpaceX is advancing their knowledge\u00a0reusability in practice and consequently taking concrete steps to prepare themselves for the difficult challenges that lie ahead in their pursuance of enabling sustainable colonization of Mars. Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon) promises to eventually rid the refurbishment process of the many headaches that salt water intrusion undoubtedly creates by returning via supersonic retropropulsion to a landing pad, much like Core 35 did this past Saturday.", "Looking slightly further into the future, SpaceX has already announced plans to launch two unnamed private customers in a Dragon 2 on what would likely be ", "a circumlunar free return trajectory, or around the Moon and back", ". The reentry velocity would be\u00a0very similar to the velocity required to return to Earth from Mars, and certainly much faster than any reentry from geostationary orbits of Earth. If SpaceX manages to successfully and reliably recover and reuse orbital vehicles reentering at such high velocities, then the company will have made extraordinarily promising progress towards achieving their central goal of drastically lowering cost to orbit and thus enabling humanity to gain footholds on other planets.", "So, take this Dragon reuse as you will. It may well be a major step along the way to colonizing Mars, or it may simply be an exciting practical implementation of SpaceX\u2019s philosophy of reuse. Either way, this is a Dragon that is certainly worth celebrating."]},

If successful, this would demonstrate weekly single-vehicle launch cadence, something that has not been seen in the launch industry in quite some time. This weekly cadence, if successful, will demonstrate a maturing company that is truly preparing for extraordinary launch cadence. By using two pads, one in California and one in Florida, SpaceX will still be able to provide two weeks between launches in order to prepare each launch site for the next launch, while effectively launching once a week. While Vandenberg Air Force Base can only support polar orbit launches,\u00a0LC-40 is currently deep into the process of being repaired and reactivated following the failure of a Falcon 9 late last year.", "With LC-40 preparing for reactivation sometime in August or September, SpaceX will find themselves at long last with two viable all-purpose launch pads in very close proximity to each other.

A successful weekly cadence this month could reinforce that such a sequence of events is a\u00a0possibility.", "SpaceX has long been working to rapidly increase its ability to launch frequently, and this year has been an exceptional example of several pieces fitting together. The company has begun to use an automated flight termination system, which will allow them to rely less upon the availability of Cape Canaveral\u2019s Range Officers while crafting their manifest and launch schedules. Normally,\u00a0the flight termination system in rockets is monitored by an actual team of people who have barely a few seconds to decide if rocket telemetry is less than nominal and prevent what is effectively a large missile from impacting populated areas. SpaceX has replaced this with an arguably much safer approach dependent upon their mature autonomous avionics systems, simply meaning that computers on board their rockets and spacecraft automatically analyze telemetry and control vehicle performance and guidance. SpaceX has been testing this system in a way that is almost identical to Tesla\u2019s method of installing inert autonomy software that can learn without actually controlling the vehicle, and it is consequently only now being implemented after SpaceX and the Air Force have a high degree of confidence that it will outperform its human colleagues.", "The ultimate goal of this automated flight termination system (AFTS), as well as many other significant changes to both the hardware of pads and vehicles, is to eventually allow SpaceX to accomplish Elon Musk\u2019s long fabled and oft-ridiculed goal of 24-hour reusability, and thus 24-hour launch cadence. SpaceX and the USAF have both stated that\u00a0AFTS alone will likely allow Cape Canaveral ", "to support up to 48 launches a year", ".

The accuracy is best understood within the context of Falcon 9\u2019s scale and the general scope of orbital rocketry.", "The first stage of Falcon 9 Full Thrust, currently the active version of Falcon 9, stands 140 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter. If you can, for a moment, picture a 737 airliner, the plane most people have likely flown aboard on domestic flights. The first stage of Falcon 9 is the same length or greater and the same diameter as Boeing\u2019s workhorse airliner. If you are now imagining a 737 landing on its tail aboard an ocean-going barge, that is a great start. The most common version of the 737, the -800, has an empty weight of 91,000 lb, while Falcon 9\u2019s empty first stage is a bit more than half as heavy.

At the peak of its trips, the first stage is often completely outside of the vast majority of the atmosphere, meaning that aerodynamic forces are no longer relevant or useful for the vehicle. This is where the cold gas thrusters come in: by carrying their reaction mass with them (the gas), Falcon 9 can maneuver outside of the atmosphere. Once the stage descends into thicker\u00a0atmospheric conditions, the grid fins deploy and are used like wings to guide the stage down to its landing location, be that on\u00a0land or at sea. While the gas thrusters lose a lot of their utility once in the atmosphere, they can still be used to add a small amount of control authority when needed.

Without delving further into the details, this is best summarized as \u201cinsanely fast\u201d, and is a bit faster than the X-15 rocketplane\u2019s fastest recorded speed. To better put this into context, Falcon 9 1038\u00a0traveled to an altitude of 240,000 meters at a top speed of 2,400 meters per second, turned around, and landed on an autonomous barge about two feet off of its optimal target. It is truly difficult to describe how impressive\u00a0that kind of accuracy is.", "Mr. Musk nevertheless did not let 1038 steal all the fanfare, and revealed that the first stage responsible for launching BulgariaSat-1, 1029, had the honor of being the fastest first stage yet, clocking in at at a truly staggering Mach 7.9, or 2,700 meters per second. That speedy mission marked the stage\u2019s second flight and was SpaceX\u2019s second successful reuse of a Falcon 9.

He put forth a strong argument that it would be in the best interests of both NASA and the\u00a0United States to encourage commercial competition in pursuit of the exploration of deep space, and that this could be done with concrete\u00a0goals like improved interplanetary communications, vertically landing spacecraft on the Moon, and sending substantial amounts of cargo to Mars.", "Before joining SpaceX, Hughes was the central actor responsible for drafting and supporting the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, which effectively paved the way for NASA\u2019s first programs of commercial competition just two years later. He joined the company in 2005, and has\u00a0defined SpaceX\u2019s approach to legal and government affairs in the many years since.", "Leveraging data related to the major successes and efficiency of NASA\u2019s Commercial Orbital Transport Services (COTS) initiative, which began in earnest in 2006, Hughes demonstrated that by awarding SpaceX with funds from COTS, NASA ultimately found themselves with a highly-capable orbital launch vehicle after a relatively miniscule investment of\u00a0$396 million into the venture. A study later conducted by NASA estimated that developing the same vehicle with a traditional NASA or commercial approach would have cost approximately $4 billion or\u00a0$1.7 billion respectively, implying that the COTS approach was as much as ten times more efficient than NASA\u2019s own traditional strategies of launch vehicle procurement.", "Of course, SpaceX themselves invested over $500 million initially following NASA\u2019s COTS award, but NASA\u2019s bode of confidence in the company likely made it possible in the first place for it to raise that level of funding. The point of this presented data, of course, is to segue into the argument that the introduction of commercial competition into the field of deep space exploration could also benefit NASA in the sense that it might be drastically more cost effective than current approaches. Hughes did not explicitly call out any current programs during his testimony, but the clear figureheads are the Space Launch System and Orion. Such a request from private industry also acts as a bit of a gentle suggestion to those in NASA, related Congressional and Senatorial committees. Subcommittees that past and current traditional strategies of hardware procurement for space exploration may be showing signs of age and obsolescence in the face of more efficient commercial ventures.", "In fact, NASA\u2019s Chief of Spaceflight,\u00a0Bill Gerstenmaier, admitted earlier today in a very rare streak of candor that ", "he \u201c[couldn\u2019t] put a date on humans on Mars\u201d", " and that that was a result of a severe lack of budget to design and build the myriad technologies, hardware, and vehicles necessary to actually take advantage of a heavy launch vehicle like the Space Launch System. NASA is admittedly beginning to pursue and request industry information for what they are calling a Deep Space Gateway or NEXTSTEP, intended to be a small orbital base or space station located closer to the Moon than to Earth. A successfully-developed DSG would indeed become one completed facet of the architecture needed to bring humans to Mars, and can be compared in concept to SpaceX\u2019s Big Falcon Spaceship in a limited fashion.", "Given Gestenmaier\u2019s frank admittance that NASA\u2019s budget is not presently able to support even a fraction of what is necessary for their \u201cJourney to Mars\u201d, exploring alternative methods of more efficiently exploiting the money NASA could realistically make available for further deep space\u00a0exploration is almost certainly a major priority, or it at least ought to be. Gertsenmaier\u2019s unspoken need for more efficient\u00a0methods of exploring Mars and deep space would perfectly mesh with the requested program SpaceX\u2019s Tim Hughes also presented earlier today, and the\u00a0potential benefits SpaceX might also reap from such an arrangement make it worth serious consideration.", "The political and corporate mire\u00a0that NASA is almost innately intertwined with is the primary and most obvious barrier to the existence of a deep space COTS-esque program, but it is possible that some amount of calculated politicking on behalf of SpaceX could result in the right Senators or\u00a0Representatives getting behind SpaceX\u2019s mission of\u00a0cost-effective space exploration."]},

The ELC (EELV (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle) Launch Contract) is the source of this controversy, and while not quite a full billion dollars, the FY2016 ELC contract was for $860 million.", "SpaceX has admittedly been chronically doubted and mistreated in the realm of government contracting, and ULA has been less than perfectly civil in the past. Simply by existing, SpaceX in effect disrupted what was a American launch industry monopoly held between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Those two companies merged their space endeavors approximately 11 years ago and have since been the United Launch Alliance. For reasons that do make a bit of sense but are still mildly obtuse, the United States Air Force chose to purchase ULA launch vehicles and the services that make the launch of those vehicles possible separately. The main given reason for this choice, as explored in Bruno\u2019s editorial, is to give the Air Force added flexibility.", "As discussed in the 2016 ELC contract itself", ", another large need for this type of funding lies in the maintenance of a large workforce, and the constant depreciation of both the Atlas and Delta families of launch vehicles. The Delta family, known mainly for the large Delta IV Heavy, is almost never utilized at this point in time, with Atlas being both more cost effective and more reliable. Regardless, due to contracting, ULA is required to maintain both the workforce and facilities necessary to produce and launch Delta vehicles, in spite of having nearly no \u201cbusiness\u201d thanks to Atlas V. Maintaining a workforce and set of facilities that is in part or whole redundant is not efficient or cost-effective, but it is contractually required. So, while the ELC contract Musk deemed a nearly pointless subsidy does have some major flaws, inefficiencies, and illogical aspects, it is not technically correct to label it a subsidy.", "\u00a0", "Without the actual contract information, it is also difficult to know if ULA would still receive this contractual payment in lieu of conducting actual launches. Bruno frames it in such a way that it sounds like the U.S. government modifies the payment size based on the number and type of required launches for a given year. If the multi-year agreement means that launches delayed many months or more can still be swapped out at no additional charge, then this does indeed make a certain amount of sense. The array of discussion on the subject nevertheless fails to explore the consequences of launch provider-side issues, the likes of which ULA and Atlas 5 experienced earlier this year, resulting in some amount of delays.", "While there can be no doubt that the actual gritty details of the ELC contracts deal explicitly with such possible outcomes, the lack of transparency (be that as a result of publicly inaccessible contract details or highly obtuse and lingo-heavy contract language) ultimately frames ELC contracts and the vehemence with which ULA defends them as a wasteful, overly complex, and unnecessary alternative to simply offering a fixed product with services inherently included, as SpaceX does."]},

A great deal of the experiments and cargo that have enabled such a burgeoning low Earth orbit economy aboard the ISS have been brought there in part by SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, which marked the first commercial spacecraft to reach orbit and later visit the International Space Station in 2010 and 2012 respectively.", "Lightfoot actively asked himself and the audience what the future of the ISS may be or ought to be, and clearly had every desire to ensure the future of the vibrant LEO economy that the ISS has enabled. Whether this means that the ISS continues to function indefinitely or is replaced with a commercial platform, it will be necessary for NASA to eventually decrease or cut completely their funding burden of the ISS if NASA wishes to better develop the hardware and create the knowledge necessary for manned Mars exploration.", "Undertaking all that is necessary, and doing it successfully, will require a great deal of cooperation in the development of space policy in the present and near future.

This will likely occur once Falcon Heavy has successfully flown several times from LC-39A, thus freeing SpaceX to deem the vehicle operational and less at risk of destroying one of their two Eastern pads.", "There is also a tentative understanding that SpaceX is striving to construct and activate their planned Boca Chica, Texas launch complex by 2019. The successful reactivation of LC-40 and subsequent modification of LC-39A for Falcon Heavy will leave the brunt of SpaceX\u2019s launch complex maintenance and construction teams free to focus entirely on the Texas facility sometime late this year or early next year, meaning that Boca Chica pad activation could certainly occur as early as 2019.

Likely no coincidence, SpaceX simultaneously offered information to insurance underwriters about the increasing speed of their ability to launch, recover, and reuse first stages. More specifically, a spokesman of the company stated that the reuse of BulgariaSat-1\u2019s Falcon 9 1029 took considerably less than half as long as the inaugural reuse of the stage that launched SES-10 earlier this year, implying that refurbishment and quality assurance checks for 1029 took something like four or five months total.", "With SpaceX having ", "debuted new titanium grid fins", " intended to speed up reuse on the Sunday launch of Iridium-2, the company is well on its way to transferring over to Block 4 (upgraded engine performance) and possibly Block 5 of Falcon 9 later this. Block 5 is expected to introduced major changes meant to replace aspects of the current Falcon 9 that require major refurbishment after recovery. Musk detailed these changes several months ago in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), mentioning that reusable heat shielding around the engines, improved landing legs, and titanium grid fins were the main aspects of a Block 5 of Falcon 9 meant to offer rapid reuse without refurbishment. In June 22nd interview on the Space Show, Gwynne Shotwell reiterated that this \u201cfinal\u201d version of Falcon 9 is expected to be able to launch, land, and relaunch with barely more than a thorough once-over, and ought to be capable of flying a dozen missions at least.", "This final piece of the puzzle of weekly cadence fits in quite nicely. With a possible introduction date for Block 5 of late 2017 or early 2018, SpaceX will likely end production of Block 3 by the end of this year and transfer over entirely to the easily reusable Block 5. Assuming a continuing a trend of increasingly reuse-friendly customers, Hawthorne production capacity of approximately 20 Falcon 9s per year, and a plausibly significant reduction in launch costs due to more rapid and complete reuse, SpaceX could find themselves at the start of 2019 with a dozen or more launch vehicles that are each capable of conducting upwards of 10-12 highly affordable launches each.", "Let there be no doubt: these are incredibly optimistic and difficult goals for the company to achieve on the timescale they have provided. However, given the number of beneficial changes likely to soon be made to both the launch vehicles and SpaceX\u2019s manufacturing, launch, and refurbishment facilities in the next 6-12 months, those goals are realistically achievable, albeit with some likely delays.

", "Altogether, it\u2019s simply impossible to interpret it as anything less than Bridenstine scolding SpaceX \u2013 and SpaceX alone \u2013 for not falling to the floor, kissing NASA\u2019s feet, and pretending that Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 are the only things in existence. Absent from Bridenstine\u2019s criticism was NASA\u2019s other (and even more delay-complicit) Commercial Crew Partner, Boeing, who has yet to complete a pad abort or orbital flight test of its Starliner spacecraft. SpaceX completed Crew Dragon\u2019s pad abort in 2015 and completed a flawless orbital flight test in March 2019. ", "In essence, Bridenstine is publicly implying that SpaceX needs to stop being (or appearing to be) distracted by Starship and focus 100% on Crew Dragon. Boeing was not mentioned, despite being a minimum of six months behind SpaceX and dramatically more \u2018distracted\u2019 in the Bridenstine-style interpretation of the word. For reference, Boeing is a publicly-traded company with 150,000 employees, annual revenue of more than $100B, and a market cap of $206B. Boeing has 14 subsidiaries, a handful of which are involved in spaceflight, and has no less than one or two dozen products that are each more fiscally important to shareholders and board members than Starliner. ", "Compared to Boeing\u2019s ", "annual", " ~$100B revenue, the entirety of the Starliner development program \u2013 from the drawing board in 2010 to crewed, orbital spaceflight sometime in 2020 \u2013 is ~$4.8B. On the scale of corporate focus, Starliner has likely been a blip at most in 2019, with the company probably far more focused on the systematic organizational failures that lead to the deaths of hundreds of people in two near-identical 737 MAX crashes. Alas, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine did not release a statement publicly implying that Boeing needs to devote the \u201csame level of enthusiasm\u201d to Starliner after  the second fatal 737 MAX crash in March 2019. Nor did Bridenstine release a statement charging Boeing with a lack of focus after continuous reports of issues with the company\u2019s KC-46 Pegasus tanker program, nor Boeing\u2019s recent $9.2B US Air Force trainer jet contract, or myriad other corporate focuses. ", "On the other hand, as Musk noted in his relatively subtle September 28th responses to Bridenstine\u2019s implicitly derisive comment, something like 50-80% of the entirety of SpaceX\u2019s workforce and resources are focused on Crew Dragon, the Falcon 9 rockets that will launch it, or a combination of both. At present, Starship is \u2013 at most \u2013 a side project, even if its strategic importance to SpaceX is hard to exaggerate. The same is largely true for Starlink, SpaceX\u2019s ambitious internet satellite constellation program. It may be true that Starship will eventually make Crew and Cargo Dragon (as well as Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy) wholly redundant, but that is likely years away and SpaceX will support NASA \u2013 as it is contractually required to \u2013 for as long as the space agency has vested interest in using Crew Dragon.", "At the same time, NASA has explicitly and publicly chosen to prioritize safety over schedule with the Commercial Crew Program, accepting the possibility of delays and cost overruns to ensure that SpaceX and Boeing can build the safest spacecraft possible.", "In a September 28th interview with CNN, Musk bluntly noted that the hardware was \u2013 at this point in time \u2013 more or less ready for flight and will be on-site at SpaceX\u2019s Pad 39A Florida launch site within the next two months. According to Musk, from then on, any additional launch delays can almost entirely be attributed to the paperwork and reviews NASA must complete before giving SpaceX the go-ahead. If Bridenstine wants SpaceX to launch astronauts sooner, one \u2013 and possibly the only \u2013 solution is to tackle the roadblocks created by NASA\u2019s own self-enforced red tape. The question, then, is whether Bridenstine wants to cut away red tape that may (or may not) be there for good reason.", "Detached from whining about a contractor\u2019s CEO presenting about a non-NASA program, complaining about Commercial Crew delays is at least ", "slightly ", "more reasonable. Originally intended to launch as early as 2015, Congress systematically underfunded the Commercial Crew Program ", "by more than 50%", " for over half a decade, dispersing $2.4B of the $5.8B NASA requested from 2011 to 2016. Unsurprisingly, this completely upended Boeing and SpaceX development schedules. By September 2014, SpaceX aimed to have Crew Dragon certified by NASA for astronaut transport before the end of 2017, but even then, NASA already saw that schedule as overly optimistic.", "It would be another two years before Congress began to seriously fund Commercial Crew at its requested levels, beginning in FY2016. In response to Bridenstine, former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver noted that over the ~5 years Congress consistently withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of critical funds from Commercial Crew, NASA\u2019s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft were just as consistently ", "overfunded", " above and beyond their budget requests. From 2011 to 2016 alone, SLS and Orion programs requested $11B and received an incredible $16.3B (148%) from Congress, while Commercial Crew requested $5.8B and received $2.4B (41%). ", "Ironically, despite literally receiving almost seven times as much funding as Crew Dragon and Starliner, SLS and Orion are arguably just as \u2013 if not more \u2013 delayed than their commercial brethren. Originally intended to launch an uncrewed test flight in 2017, there is now little to no chance that that mission (known then as EM-1 and now as Artemis-1) will launch before 2022, a delay of roughly half a decade. The cost of the SLS/Orion program recently crested $30B, a figure likely to grow to ~$40B before it has conducted a single launch. Of that funding, approximately a third has gone to Boeing, the primary contractor responsible for NASA\u2019s comically-delayed SLS Core Stage \u2013 the orange booster pictured above.", "The Commercial Crew development program will likely cost NASA $8B total over 9-10 years and produce two clean-sheet, high-performance, (relatively) low-cost crewed spacecraft. After their demonstration launches are completed, NASA will transition to fixed-price service contracts with SpaceX and Boeing to routinely send astronauts to the ISS several times per year. ", "Put simply, if Bridenstine actually cared about defending \u201cthe investments of the American taxpayer\u201d more than wielding their sanctity as a political weapon, he wouldn\u2019t have folded like a house of cards at the slightest resistance to his attempts to cull SLS/Orion delays and cost overruns, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t be wasting breath complaining about what SpaceX\u2019s CEO is or isn\u2019t talking about.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

In October 2018, Musk finally managed to convince most of the senior engineers reporting to him that \u2013 despite years of work and full-scale testing \u2013 SpaceX needed to radically redesign Starship.

According to Musk, the high-quality carbon fiber composites SpaceX was originally pursuing cost something like $130,000 per metric ton, translating to a truly gobsmacking cost \u2013 accounting for unavoidable wastage \u2013 of $400M-$500M or more ", "just", " to buy the materials needed to build a single Starship and Super Heavy booster.

It remains to be seen if the eccentric self-taught engineer\u2019s decision was the correct one, but the progress SpaceX has made in just 10-11 months is undeniable. SpaceX has gone from a nearly blank slate to Starhopper\u2019s 150m (500ft) test flight in ~6 months and gone from nothing to Starship Mk1 in another 6 or so months.

Combined with an analysis of data gathered during the static fire, this process \u2013 when all goes as planned \u2013 can take at least 48 hours from start to finish, and longer still if any minor off-nominal behavior is observed or the launch customer has additional requirements (typically reserved for NASA and national security-related missions).", "\u00a0", "Because rockets like Falcon 9 are extraordinarily intricate and finely-tuned machines, perfectly nominal launch-related events are few and far between.

As of now, all subscale and full-scale Raptor engine static fire testing has been performed at horizontal test stands in McGregor, apparently resulting in wear and behavior that would not likely appear if engines were tested vertically.", "SpaceX has gone through the same process with its Merlin engine programs, beginning with horizontal testing (far easier and simpler) but ultimately building a number of dedicated vertical test bays to ensure that engine acceptance and development tests can be performed under more flight-like conditions.

On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that B1059 suffered an unusually damaging reentry for unknown reasons, although it\u2019s hard to judge from photos and a layperson perspective alone.", "From a few angles, it almost appears as if B1059\u2019s white paint was completely burned or scoured off in places, leaving a distinct transition between the edge of remaining paint and the booster\u2019s distinctly metallic-looking skin underneath it.

A step further, NASA itself once heavily relied on similar technologies and strategies to rapidly build, test, and fly rockets larger than anything that came before them.", "Most notably, the Saturn I rocket that preceded the massive Saturn V used a launch mount and flame diverter that looks quite similar to a conceptual setup SpaceX recently showed off in an updated Starship launch render.

Conceptually, both mounts are topped with a flat surface with numerous support arms and a large cutout for the rocket to sit atop and its exhaust to exit through. Similar to Falcon 9, the single-core Super Heavy booster mount shown in SpaceX renders will likely have four hold-down clamps and two tail service masts (TSMs), umbilical connections that supply the rocket with propellant, electricity, connectivity, and any other required fluids.

If not, the company has experience with alternatives through Merlin Vacuum, which can only be tested on the ground with its lengthy nozzle detached. This method just makes it dramatically harder to optimize a vacuum nozzle design, as full-scale, flight-like testing is nearly impossible if a given vacuum engine can\u2019t be tested on the ground with said nozzle installed.

In a very simplistic sense, a rocket engine nozzle directs the flow of superheated, ultrafast gases in order to squeeze as much momentum transfer as possible out of available propellant. The lower the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is, the more those gases will expand immediately after leaving the nozzle \u2013 giant vacuum nozzles simply try to harness the additional momentum available from that extra expansion. This is why rocket exhausts appear to spread and thin out as launch vehicles reach higher and higher altitudes.

The job of vacuum rocket engineers is to find the perfect balance between that impractical theoretical perfection and the limits of real-world materials and dynamics. In theory, SpaceX\u2019s sea-level Raptor engines have already been designed to operate in vacuum conditions, while the engine\u2019s closed-cycle design and regeneratively (i.e. propellant) cooled nozzle should apply well to a vacuum design.

Known as the tripod stand, the large concrete structure was originally built in the 1990s by Beal Aerospace, a now-defunct spaceflight startup, and came under SpaceX ownership when the company bought the McGregor, Texas facilities in 2003. ", "SpaceX repurposed the stand to static fire Falcon 9 boosters for a number of years, eventually replacing it with a ground-level installation in 2015 that has since been used to test more than 60 Falcon 9 (and Heavy) boosters. It\u2019s not a huge surprise that SpaceX decided to make the change, given that the tripod stand necessarily placed Falcon boosters several hundred feet off the ground, making what was already a challenge even more arduous (and dangerous) for workers. ", "NASASpaceflight.com also notes that the stand produced far more noise pollution, encouraging SpaceX to move the replacement stand partially underground.", "After four years of inactivity, NASASpaceflight.com photos show that SpaceX is well into the process of refurbishing McGregor\u2019s tripod stand. This time, Musk says it will be modified to support vertical Raptor engine testing, likely requiring a new custom mount and new liquid methane and oxygen propellant farms. ", "By far the most interesting detail to come out of this development is Musk\u2019s indication that moving Raptor static fires to a vertical stand could actually allow SpaceX to simplify the engine\u2019s design by creating more flight-like test conditions (and thus better data). At the moment, all Raptor acceptance testing is done on a separate test stand located elsewhere at SpaceX\u2019s McGregor facilities. Those stands are horizontal, an engineering decision likely motivated by their relatively cheap and fast construction thanks to sidestepping the need for large, water-cooled thrust diverters.", "SpaceX does all of its Merlin Vacuum, Merlin 1D, Falcon 9 booster, and upper stage static fire testing on vertical stands at its McGregor facilities, with Raptor\u2019s horizontal stands being the only exception to the rule. As such, it was likely just a matter of time before SpaceX replaced the horizontal Raptor facilities with vertical stands. Given that SpaceX plans to modify an entirely separate stand to support vertical testing, it\u2019s likely that the company will modify the existing stands to support vertical testing as soon as the tripod stand is up and running.", "For Falcon 9 and Heavy, SpaceX has relied on a total of five main engine/vehicle test stands: two for Merlin 1D, one for MVac, one for boosters, and one for upper stages. SpaceX builds engines and rockets in Hawthorne, tests every engine separately in Texas, returns them to Hawthorne, installs them on their respective booster/upper stage, and tests those stages in McGregor before they are shipped to their launch site. ", "Although that sounds undeniably arduous, the four stands pictured above (plus the F9 booster stand further up) have managed to support the entirety of SpaceX\u2019s 82 launches. A new upper stage test stand is being built, but it has yet to be completed and is only necessary because Falcon 9 upper stages are expendable. According to SpaceX planning documents, Starship and Super Heavy will only perform static fire testing at the launch site. As such, something like the cluster of four Merlin stands above could very likely support the production and testing of 100-200+ Raptor engines annually, enough to build numerous boosters and ships.

Intriguingly, Musk expressed that he has not fully \u201cbought into\u201d this updated design, motivated by analyses that indicated that separating the legs and fins would actually be a lighter solution than combining them. This is certainly unintuitive, but it\u2019s extremely encouraging to hear that Musk is seriously trusting and bowing to the educated opinions of some of the extremely skilled engineers that SpaceX is known for.", "Like the circa-2018 design, Starship 2019 will feature two actuating wings/fins near its rear and another two canard-like control surfaces near the nose. A third non-functional fin may or may not serve as a leg in the 2019 design.

The need for all that power (Crew Dragon relies on a few-kWh battery) is directly related to Starship Mk1\u2019s methods of reentry and recovery, recently described in detail by Elon Musk.", "As noted above, ~400 kWh of batteries are needed to power the electric motors that will actuate Starship\u2019s massive control surfaces \u2013 two large aft wings and two forward canards/fins. According to Musk, Starship\u2019s \u201cstability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing\u201d, meaning that the spacecraft will need to constantly tweak its control surfaces to remain in stable flight. ", "By far the biggest challenge SpaceX faces is ensuring that Starship can survive numerous orbital-velocity reentries with little to no wear and tear, a necessity for Starship to be cost-effective. In Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Starship will be traveling no less than 7.8 km/s (Mach 23, 17,500 mph) at the start of atmospheric reentry. In simple terms, the process of slowing from orbital velocity to landing on Earth involves turning the vast majority of that kinetic energy into heat. As Musk noted yesterday, this reality is just shy of unavoidable but there ", "is ", "some flexibility in terms of how quickly one wants to convert that energy into heat. ", "The fastest route to Earth would involve diving straight into the atmosphere, dramatically increasing peak heating on a spacecraft\u2019s surface to the point that extremely exotic heat shields and thermal protections systems become an absolute necessity. SpaceX wants to find a middle ground with Starship in which the spacecraft uses its aerodynamic control surfaces and body to generate lift, slowly and carefully lowering itself into Earth\u2019s atmosphere over a period of 15+ minutes. Musk notes that this dramatically lessens peak heating at the cost of increasing the overall amount of energy Starship has to dissipate, a bit like cooking something in the oven at 300 degrees for 30 minutes instead of 600 degrees for 10 minutes. ", "To an extent, Starship\u2019s reentry profile is actually quite similar to NASA\u2019s now-retired Space Shuttle, which took approximately 30 minutes to go from its reentry burn to touchdown. Per the above infographic, it looks like Starship will take approximately 20 minutes from orbit to touchdown, owing to a dramatically different approach once it reaches slower speeds. Originally described by Musk in September 2018 and again in recent weeks, Starship will essentially stall itself until its forward velocity is nearly zero, after which the giant spacecraft will fall belly-down towards the Earth, using its wings and fins to maneuver like a skydiver. The Space Shuttle landed on a runway like a (cement-encased) glider.", "This unusual approach allows SpaceX to sidestep the need for huge wings, preventing Starship from wasting far more mass on aerodynamic surfaces it will rarely need. The Space Shuttle is famous for its massive, tile-covered delta wing and the leading-edge shielding that partially contributed to the Columbia disaster. However, it\u2019s a little-known fact that the wing\u2019s size and shape were ", "almost entirely attributable to US Air Force demands", " for cross-range performance, meaning that the military wanted Shuttles to be able to travel 1000+ miles during reentry and flight. This dramatically constrained the Shuttle\u2019s design and was ", "never once", " used for its intended purpose.", "SpaceX thankfully doesn\u2019t have its own \u201cUS Air Force\u201d stand-in making highly consequential demands (aside from Elon Musk \ud83d\ude09). Instead, Starship will continue the SpaceX tradition of vertical landing, falling straight down \u2013 a bit like a skydiver (or a brick) \u2013 on its belly and flipping itself over with fins and thrusters for a propulsive vertical landing. In this way, Starship doesn\u2019t have to be a brick forced to fly, like the Shuttle was \u2013 it just needs to be able to stably fall and quickly flip itself from a horizontal to vertical orientation.", "Additionally, Starship is built almost entirely out of steel, whereas the Shuttle relied on an aluminum alloy and needed thermal protection over every square inch of its hull. Steel melts at nearly twice the temperature of the Shuttle\u2019s alloy, meaning that Starship will (hopefully) be able to get away with nothing more than ceramic tiles on its windward half, saving mass, money, and time. Once Starship completes its first 20 km (12.5 mi) flight test(s), currently scheduled no earlier than mid-October, SpaceX will likely turn its focus on verifying Starship\u2019s performance at hypersonic speeds, ultimately culminating in its first orbital-velocity reentries.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

This is the latest addition to SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s relatively close relationship \u2013 the two have begun to work together to solve challenges with materials science, batteries, and more within the last 12-24 months.", "While initially surprising, the appearance of battery packs quite literally taken from Tesla Model S/X vehicles or their Gigafactory assembly line actually makes a lot of sense. By using prepackaged, off-the-shelf battery systems with industry-leading power management capabilities, SpaceX is probably saving a huge amount of time, money, and effort. If the battery packs were already nearing the end of their useful automotive lives, the net cost could very well approach zero, aside from what looks like a minimal mounting brace. It\u2019s possible that SpaceX has even pursued modifying and certifying large Tesla-derived battery packs for use on orbital Starship missions.", "These battery packs were spotted by an eagle-eyed forum user who was first to recognize the hardware for what it likely was. Per the above photo, SpaceX appears to have joined two self-contained Tesla battery packs into single units that were then installed on a header tank. Knowing that the highest capacity Tesla offers is ~100 kWh, the 2\u00d72 packs could store up to 400 kWh and offer instantaneous power output (ignoring thermal limitations) well into the megawatt (MW) range. It\u2019s unclear if the first header tank also had batteries attached but SpaceX technicians began installing that tank inside Starship\u2019s nose cone on the evening September 22nd.

These tanks compliment the rocket prototype\u2019s main propellant tanks and are meant to serve as small reserves of fuel (methane) and oxidizer (oxygen) that can be pressurized independently. During dramatic in-space and in-atmosphere maneuvers, the g-forces exerted on Starship could easily find the vehicle\u2019s propellant pushed away from the \u2018bottom\u2019 of its main tanks, creating bubbles or voids that can damage and destroy rocket engines if ingested.", "Pressurizing the entirety of the main tanks (a cylinder measuring 9m by ~40m or 30\u00d7130 ft) is extremely impractical \u2013 hence the need for much smaller header tanks. Falcon 9 boosters are able to sidestep this issue because they are small and light enough (relatively speaking) that cold gas thrusters can efficiently generate the positive Gs needed to safely ignite its engines for recovery and landing maneuvers. Empty, Starship alone will likely weigh no less than 4-6 times as much as a Falcon 9 booster (~25 tons, 55,000 lb).", "According to CEO Elon Musk, SpaceX has decided to install those header tanks in the very tip of Starship Mk1\u2019s conical nose to help balance out the vehicle\u2019s center of mass. As a side-effect, SpaceX will have to install feed lines that run the entire length of the spacecraft and protect them with steel aero-covers.

Either way, it can be extrapolated \u2013 assuming that the layout of BFR 2017 is generally representative of BFR 2018 \u2013 that the first spaceship prototype will require two or three roughly identical tank domes. If the common-dome tank layout is basically the same (disclaimer: it might be quite different), then SpaceX may end up mounting BFS\u2019 7 Raptor engines almost directly to the rear of the bottom tank dome, requiring either significant structural reinforcement or a second uniquely-engineer and optimized dome.", "\u00a0", "Judging from SpaceX\u2019s and Musk\u2019s desire to make reusable rockets as reliable as (if not even more reliable than) commercial airliners, the safest form of mass-transit humans have created, it seems more likely than not that Raptor and BFR will continue SpaceX\u2019s practice of quite literally surrounding each engine with thrust-transmitting structures that simultaneously act as armored shields. In the event that a Merlin engine fails on Falcon 9 or Heavy, each booster\u2019s octaweb contains nine separate armored chambers that exist to isolate each engine in the event of a catastrophic failure. In fact, a Merlin failure \u2013 the only such in-flight failure known \u2013 during SpaceX\u2019s CRS-1 Dragon launch in 2012 demonstrated the efficacy of this design, preventing the failure of just one of nine engines from causing total mission failure.", "To replicate that design strategy on BFR (both booster and spaceship) would be an act of simple pragmatism \u2013 it\u2019s always preferable to design for survivability\u00a0", "and\u00a0", "reliability\u00a0than to couch launch and mission success primarily on the reliability of individual components.

The ultimate goal of Falcon 9 Block 5 is to enable at least 10 reflights with minimal refurbishment, and the 3rd reflight is the next major step in that direction.", "While we still do not have an official idea of the payload\u2019s weight, Falcon 9 placed the roughly 3000-kg communications satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), where Es\u2019hail-2 will gradually climb Earth\u2019s gravity well to a circular orbit under the power of its own small propulsion system.

The rocket then returned to Port Canaveral and was transported to one of SpaceX\u2019s nearby facilities for repair, refurbishment, and inspection around the end of July. According to President and COO Gwynne Shotwell, Block 5 rockets \u2013 as of September 2018 \u2013 require just four weeks or refurbishment on average. Although July-November is not exactly four weeks, it\u2019s possible that the process was completed months ago and the rocket has simply been waiting in the wings for the availability of its next payload.", "As it turns out, SpaceX decided to conduct the rocket\u2019s second launch from a different launch pad, known as Pad 39A. 39A is in the process of being modified to support Crew Dragon launches, including a variety of changes to its ground support equipment, the transporter/erector (T/E), and the Fixed Service Structure (FSS), most notably signified by the installation of gleaming black and white crew access arm (CAA). While the reasoning behind the move from LC-40 to LC-39A is opaque, the likeliest explanation is that SpaceX wanted an opportunity to shake down a majority of those modifications to reduce schedule uncertainty and risk for Crew Dragon\u2019s uncrewed launch debut, NET early January 2019.", "Ultimately, as stated by a SpaceX announcer during the webcast, B1047\u2019s successful second launch and landing aboard OCISLY paves the way for a potential third launch and landing for the rocket, perhaps just a few months away.

While suboptimal, a few general characteristics of each payload, SpaceX\u2019s history of commercial launches, and Falcon Heavy itself can offer a hint or two.", "Thanks in large part to the fact that the first integrated Falcon Heavy was composed of two relatively old Falcon 9 booster variants and a center core that was quite literally a one-off rocket, the process of reenginering and building another Falcon Heavy rocket off of the family\u2019s newest Block 5 variant has likely been far harder than simply", " building another Falcon Heavy", ". Although all three original Falcon Heavy boosters (B1023, B1025, and B1033) were in the same league as Block 5, their Block 2 and Block 3 hardware was designed for approximately 10% less thrust and are almost entirely different vehicles from the perspective of structures and avionics.", "Perhaps even more importantly, it\u2019s unknown whether Falcon Heavy Block 1 (for lack of a better descriptor) was designed with serious reusability in mind, at least in the same sense as Falcon 9 Block 5 was. For instance, a major portion of the rocket\u2019s extreme complexity and difficulties lies in the basic need to transmit three times as much thrust through the center core. To do that and do it without rocket-powered separation\u00a0mechanisms, SpaceX had to develop structural\u00a0attachments and connections capable of surviving unbelievable mechanical and thermal stresses for minutes on end.", "\u00a0", "Clearly, this was an unfathomably difficult problem to solve in such a manner that Falcon Heavy would work at all\u00a0", "the first time.\u00a0", "Factor in the strategic need for those same components to survive repeated cycles of those stresses with minimal refurbishment in between and the problem at hand likely becomes a magnitude more difficult, at least.

More importantly, from an operational standpoint, this is something that the company has simply never attempted, meaning that while it\u2019s similar in concept to\u00a0the numerous booster reuses SpaceX engineers and technicians have already pulled off, every aspect of B1046\u2019s refurbishment and preparation for another launch is new territory for all.", "In this sense, even the most minor observations and procedural developments are likely being documented with extreme care, paving the way for the systematic refurbishment of Block 5 boosters with 2+ launches on their\u00a0manifest. Similar to how car mechanics know to look at and for dramatically different things depending on the age of the car and the time since its last maintenance, reusable rockets are likely to require an even more exotic and unintuitive approach to multi-flight maintenance and repair diagnostics. As such, it should come as little surprise that SpaceX chose to delay SSO-A a few days to ensure that the rocket is ready to safely place its payload in orbit.", "Aside from the extreme importance of its third launch, Falcon 9 B1046 will be subject to another rather unique situation. Barely a mile or two northeast of SpaceX\u2019s SLC-4 launch complex, a ULA Delta IV Heavy rocket is assembled and nearly ready to\u00a0place\u00a0the National Reconnaissance Office\u2019s classified\u00a0NROL-71 satellite into a high-energy Earth orbit. If the extraordinarily expensive launch vehicle (~$350-400M) it sits atop of is any sign, NROL-71 is a massive satellite that cost the NRO anywhere from $500M to $2B to design, procure, and prepare for launch.", "In other words, the sheer capital at risk has likely resulted in a bit of manifest and range jockeying between Falcon 9/SpaceX and Delta Heavy/ULA/NRO.

In this odd and unused landing mode, Falcon 9 will perform a sort of RTLS Lite, returning back in the direction of the launch site but not going far enough to actually reach it.", "In doing so, B1046 will \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 become the first Falcon 9 booster to land on both SpaceX drone ships and launch from all three of the company\u2019s orbital facilities, LC-40 (Cape Canaveral Air Force Station), LC-39A (Kennedy Space Center), and SLC-4 (Vandenberg Air Force Base)."]},

Most notably, these changes include the installation of a visible and quite curious stanchion (or arm) at the ship\u2019s aft\u00a0tip (nose). Simply due to a lack of any real information about the experiences of operating Mr. Steven and attempting to catch Falcon fairings, it\u2019s all but impossible to know for sure what this new limb accomplishes or why it was needed in the first place.", "More clear are general visual observations and the reasonable extrapolations that can be derived from them. At the simplest level, this new limb is clearly well-reinforced, at least no less so than any of Mr. Steven\u2019s other arms and attachment points. Aside from a basic off-the-shelf ladder for crew and technician access, the stanchion plays host to four basic swinging arms with what looks like one or maybe one and a half degrees of freedom, allowing them to pivot roughly 180 degrees along the plane of the angle they were installed at.", "\u00a0", "Secured to the ends of those four simple arms are four heavy-duty coiled metal cables, themselves attached to the center of Mr. Steven\u2019s two foremost arms (two cables per arm). Curiously, the ship\u2019s Nov. 12 sea trials were conducted with just the bottom two cables attached to each respective arm, visible in photos of the outing.

During the nearby sea trials, no clearly abnormal behavior \u2013 compared against previous trials at similar speeds and the same location \u2013 was observed, although the new metal cables were visibly taut or nearly so.", "Given just how seemingly nuanced the utility of this new arm and cable combo seems to be, a few obvious conclusions and possible explanations can be drawn. Perhaps Mr. Steven experiences inconvenient arm bouncing while sailing at high speeds, particularly in high speeds, and holding his arms down serves to grease the metaphorical gears of fairing recovery. Maybe the recovery net \u2013 stretched between four large arms \u2013 is tensioned more than SpaceX fairing recovery engineers and technicians would like, partially shrinking the usable catching area by pulling each arm towards the center. Even more nuanced still, it may be the case that these new tensioning steel cables and stanchion make it easier for fairing halves to be processed after landing in Mr. Steven\u2019s net, allowing the crew to accurately and rapidly move the fairing to an optimal section of the net.", "Regardless, none of these best-case, simple explanations for the new hardware satisfactorily mesh with the known facts surrounding Mr. Steven and Falcon fairing recovery in general.

Even then, a 5-7 day delay can be extremely unsavory for many customers, as time is very frequently money for satellite operators \u2013 a satellite on the ground is essentially a black hole that devours capital and generates zero revenue, sort of like a nuclear reactor that hasn\u2019t been connected to the grid.", "B1047\u2019s successful return to port after a second operational launch will serve as another valuable wealth of data that can be used to further optimize SpaceX\u2019s understanding of Falcon 9 Block 5 and its capabilities."]},

In this case, the rocket would be mounted some distance from the ground to minimize acoustic loads on the vehicle\u2019s after and would likely include a water deluge system to further deaden thermal and acoustic energy while also minimizing damage to the concrete and metal structures that launch and landing pads are built out of.", "\u00a0", "Above all else, the presence of not one but two huge ~100,000-gallon vacuum-insulated tanks at SpaceX\u2019s Boca Chica facilities all but guarantees that the company intends to situate a serious campaign of BFR tests there, likely including the integrated spaceship hop tests both Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell have explicitly mentioned in recent months.

Reasons for the multitude of delays since Falcon Heavy\u2019s successful February 2018 debut are few and far between, with the most likely explanation being some combination of issues with one or several of the ~25 satellites manifested and SpaceX\u2019s ability to build a new Falcon Heavy rocket in time.", "However, it\u2019s decidedly ambiguous as to which one of those explanations truly takes precedence, given that SpaceX apparently told the USAF and its customers that it was ready to launch the mission between June and August.", "Assuming SpaceX\u2019s launch readiness announcement was accurate, the USAF and its customers must have run into some extreme issues while\u00a0organizing all STP-2 payloads and integrating those satellites onto a custom-built adapter, a task that companies like Spaceflight Industries have shown to often be the long pole of rideshare launches. It\u2019s also possible that SpaceX executives and managers underestimated or undersold the challenge of moving from a Falcon Heavy built solely on old Falcon 9 Block 2 and 3 boosters to an all-Block 5 version of the rocket, featuring a large number of highly-consequential changes like uprated engines and an entirely new approach to assembling each booster\u2019s octaweb.", "\u00a0", "Lastly, depending on the nature of the launch contract\u00a0between them, it\u2019s possible that SpaceX had been planning on reflying Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters as its next Falcon Heavy\u2019s side boosters, a move that would dramatically shorten the lead time required for a new Falcon Heavy to be produced. If the USAF expects or has unconditionally demanded all-new hardware for the launch of STP-2, SpaceX would need at least two (if not three) times the production resources to build and test Falcon Heavy #2, all while paralyzing those resources until well after the rocket\u2019s first flight.", "Building three separate Falcon 9/Heavy boosters, acceptance-testing them in Texas, and delivering them to Florida \u2013 all under uniquely strict USAF standards \u2013 would likely take SpaceX a bare minimum of four months from start to finish. In the guaranteed event that SpaceX had to simultaneously continue regular production, test operations, and preparations for Crew Dragon launches, an all-new Falcon Heavy would likely take more than 6-8 months to make flight-ready while still allowing SpaceX to avoid severe launch delays for its many other customers.", "\u00a0", "To add additional confusion to the mix, multiple reliable sources have confirmed that STP-2\u2019s actual launch target is closer to March 2019, quite a stretch for \u201cearly 2019\u201d.

A majority of the commercial-side slips can be attributed to unexpected hardware failures between the beginning of the Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and expected launch dates, with SpaceX experiencing two catastrophic failures of Falcon 9 (CRS-7 and Amos-6) and Boeing suffering a major anomaly while performing ground tests ahead of a Starliner pad-abort. Prior to the September 2016 Amos-6 failure of Falcon 9, SpaceX was arguably on track for the inaugural launch of Crew Dragon in late-2017/early-2018, having already completed a successful pad-abort demonstration in 2015 and eight successful launches since the CRS-7 failure.", "Aside from serious hardware failures, the rest of SpaceX\u2019s Commercial Crew delays can be blamed on the company\u2019s tendency to relentlessly iterate, improve, and generally modify both its hardware and software, to the extent that SpaceX\u2019s Vice President of Production stated in mid-2018 that \u201c[SpaceX has] never built any two vehicles identically\u201d. For NASA\u2019s often dysfunctionally and counterproductively risk-averse human spaceflight divisions, that sentence alone is probably enough to trigger panic attacks. As a result, SpaceX has been led to significantly change its style of operations over the last several years, reaching some sort of compromise that was more acceptable to NASA.", "Further, despite the failures of CRS-7 and Amos-6, SpaceX continued to dramatically modify Falcon 9\u2019s design \u2013 a major vehicle-wide upgrade known as Falcon 9 1.2 (Full Thrust, Block 1) debuted on the CRS-7 return-to-flight, while Amos-6 would have been the first launch of Falcon 9 Block 3 and likely failed as a result of faster fueling procedures and much colder propellant. Less than a year later, SpaceX debuted Falcon 9 Block 4. Roughly half a year after that, SpaceX debuted Falcon 9 Block 5, perhaps the most significant upgrade to the rocket yet. Ultimately, all changes made to Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon translate into additional work for NASA and SpaceX, known formally as \u201ccertification\u201d and informally as exhaustive testing sandwiched by mountains of paperwork.", "\u00a0", "In the case of the CCP, NASA itself has been a major source of delays as Boeing and SpaceX get much closer to launch dates and hardware is effectively completed, integrated, and ready to go. According to both Hans Koenigsmann (VP of Flight Reliability) and Gwynne Shotwell (President and COO) in the last few months, both executives were supremely confident that the hardware (Crew Dragon: capsule, trunk; Falcon 9: Merlins, upper stage, booster; Launch Complex 39A) would be ready for DM-1 no later than December 2018. Those statements imply that additional delays were unlikely to be a consequence of hardware readiness, indicating that delays beyond December would presumably be caused by paperwork and/or ISS scheduling.", "In this sense, it could well be the case that NASA\u2019s behind-schedule completion of critical certification and approval paperwork \u2013 paperwork that NASA alone required and knew it would have to finish prior to launch for the last several years \u2013 will or already have delayed SpaceX\u2019s first Crew Dragon launch by at least a month.

Due to a lack of on-base space at SpaceX\u2019s Vandenberg facilities, there simply isn\u2019t enough room for multiple boosters to be worked on in the SLC-4 hangar, meaning that the arrival of one rocket necessitates the departure of another.

Based on the fact that Musk believes the mini-BFS could reach orbit as early as June 2019, it seems likely that the miniature spaceship will essentially just be a strengthened Falcon 9 upper stage with fins and a heat shield attached versus a more extreme departure, where the stage would literally be a mini-BFS.", "In the latter scenario, SpaceX could use the opportunity to extensively test \u2013 albeit on a smaller scale \u2013 a number of immature BFR technologies, including all-composite propellant tanks, autogenous pressurization, a sea level-optimized rocket engine on an orbital upper stage, methane and oxygen (methalox) propellant, actuatable tripod fins, new heat shield materials, and more. If SpaceX has been working on this for several months, there is still a chance that those technologies will be tested on this step-change Falcon 9 S2 variant, but it seems improbable that Musk would have been able to stay totally silent on the plans during his September 2018 update to the BFR program.", "Going off of what little information we have, it seems more likely that the \u201cmini-BFR ship\u201d described by Musk is an effort to realize Falcon 9 upper stage recovery and test BFR\u2019s orbital spaceship recovery strategies than it is an extensive development platform for all critical BFR technologies. Prior to today\u2019s tweet, Musk announced early this year (April, to be precise) that SpaceX would attempt to recovery Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage with a \u201cgiant\u2026balloon\u201d, or an ", "inflatable\u00a0decelerator", " to use the technical terminology.", "Given this new development, it\u2019s unclear if those plans are still on \u2013 as a small spaceship, Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage would likely be able to reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere without the need for something like a single-use inflatable decelerator, which would have always been a suboptimal crutch for the recovery of any orbital spacecraft, be it Falcon 9 or BFR. With this new plan, it appears that SpaceX wants to kill at least two birds with one stone, building a platform capable of flight-testing a handful of new technologies critical to BFR\u2019s success while also potentially realizing the dream of a fully-reusable Falcon 9.", "Given recent reports from Reuters that Musk has demanded that SpaceX\u2019s Starlink team work towards the first launch of an operational batch of satellites by mid-2019, his target date for a mini-BFS Falcon 9 upper stage is likely no coincidence. Given the potential risk of being the first to launch on an unproven variant of Falcon 9, it\u2019s possible (if not probable) that SpaceX will conduct its own launch of the rocket prior to flying paying customers \u2013 a perfect way to avoid wasting that launch would be risking a few of SpaceX\u2019s own Starlink satellites in place of a customer\u2019s payload.", "Musk seems to be confident that SpaceX has effectively \u2018solved\u2019 propulsive rocket landings, stating that the purpose of this new variant will be dedicated to testing an \u201cultra light heat shield and high Mach control surfaces\u201d.

While somewhat unintuitive, this is the second time SpaceX has intentionally destroyed largely completed Starship hardware in order to determine the limits of the company\u2019s current methods of production and assembly.", "Most notably, on November 20th, SpaceX is believed to have intentionally ", "overpressurized the Starship Mk1 prototype", " in a very similar \u2013 albeit larger-scale \u2013 test, destroying the vehicle and sending its top tank dome flying hundreds of feet into the air. It\u2019s generally believed that SpaceX (or perhaps even just Musk) decided that Starship Mk1 was not fit to fly, leading the company to switch gears and deem the prototype a \u201cmanufacturing pathfinder\u201d rather than the first Starship to fly \u2013 which Musk had explicitly stated just a few months prior.", "Instead, ", "Starship Mk1 suffered irreparable damage", " during its pressurization test and was rapidly scrapped in the weeks following, although several segments were thankfully salvaged \u2013 perhaps for use on future prototypes. Along those lines, it can arguably be said that the results from the mini Starship tank\u2019s Jan. 10 pop test have paved the way for SpaceX to build the first truly flightworthy Starship prototypes \u2013 potentially all the way up to the first spaceworthy vehicles.", "Hours after the test, Musk revealed that the Starship test tank failed almost exactly where and how SpaceX expected it would, bursting when the weld joining the upper dome and tank wall failed. Critically, the tank reached a maximum sustained pressure of 7.1 bar (103 psi), some 18% over the operating pressure (6 bar/87 psi) Musk says Starship prototypes will need to be declared fully capable of orbital test flights. In other words, given the tank\u2019s size, it survived an incredible ~20,000 metric tons (45 million lbf) of force spread out over its surface area, equivalent to about 20% the weight of an entire US Navy aircraft carrier. ", "Musk also revealed that SpaceX will require Starships to survive a minimum of 140% of that operating pressure before the company will allow the spacecraft to launch humans.", "Some have less than generously taken to smugly noting that several modern spaceflight and engineering standards require that launch vehicle tankage be rated to survive no less than 125% of their operating pressure, while this test tank would be rated for less than 118% under identical conditions. However, this ignores several significant points of interest. First and foremost, the Starship test tank intentionally destroyed on January 10th was assembled from almost nothing \u2013 going from first weld to a completed pressurization test \u2013 in less than three weeks (20 days). ", "Second, all visible welding and assembly work was performed outside in the South Texas elements with only a minor degree of protection from the coastal winds and environment. Although some obvious tweaks were made to the specific methods used to assembly the prototype tank, it also appears that most of the welding was done by hand. For the most part, in other words, the methods used to build this improved test article were largely unchanged compared to Starship Mk1, which is believed to have failed around 3-5 bar (40-75 psi).", "Additionally, it appears that almost all aspects of this test tank have smaller structural margins, meaning that the tank walls and domes are likely using steel stock that is substantially thinner than what was used on Starship Mk1. Nevertheless, thanks to the addition of continuous (single-weld) steel rings, a tweaked dome layout, and slightly refined welding, this test tank has performed anywhere from 20% to 200+% better than Starship Mk1 \u2013 again, all while coming together from scratch in a period of less than three weeks.", "As Musk notes, with relatively minor improvements to welding conditions and the manufacturing precision of Starship rings and domes, SpaceX can likely ensure that Starships (and thus Super Heavy boosters) will be able to survive pressures greater than 8.5 bar (125 psi), thus guaranteeing a safety margin of at least 40%. Even a minor improvement of ~6% would give vehicles a safety margin of 125%, enough \u2013 in the eyes of engineering standards committees \u2013 to reasonably certify Starships for orbital test flights. ", "All things considered, it\u2019s safe to assume that SpaceX is going to begin building and assembling Starship SN01 (formerly Mk3) hardware almost immediately. Given that this test tank took just 20 days to assemble, it\u2019s safe to say that the upgraded prototype\u2019s tank section could be completed in just a handful of weeks.

Those payloads often need to be placed in high-energy orbits that rely on extended upper stage coasts between orbit-raising maneuvers, essentially requiring modifications to Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage such that it becomes a sort of ad-hoc, short-lived satellite.", "However, in all (conceivable) cases where SpaceX might launch a highly-classified payload for a government customer, the dynamic is still precisely that \u2013 launch provider (SpaceX) and customer (NRO/USAF/etc). Just like FedEx or UPS have no ownership of or relationship with the goods they transport, satellite launch providers are simply delivering a (very expensive, fragile, and irreplaceable) payload from Point A (the ground) to Point B (orbit).

In some cases, the manufacturer continues to maintain or at least monitor the satellite in the background as the owner serves its own customers, much like how military airplane manufacturers are typically contracted to maintain or support those planes even after final delivery.", "Judging from the need for top-secret security clearance in nearly all of these new job postings, SpaceX clearly has a very particular sort of customer in mind.

", "Traveling as fast as Mach 2.5 (860 m/s) at an altitude of 28 kilometers (17 mi) at the point where Crew Dragon will ignite its abort thrusters and attempt to escape, that very act of escape will likely magnify the mechanical stresses on the capsule even further. During Crew Dragon\u2019s 2015 Pad Abort, for example, the spacecraft went from a standstill to 155 m/s (345 mph) in 7 seconds \u2013 an average acceleration of about 2.3 Gs. Crew Dragon C205 could thus find itself traveling almost Mach 3 (more than a kilometer per second) just seconds after separating and may ultimately reach a peak altitude of almost 75 km (45 mi).", "This is all to simply say that Crew Dragon is going to be subjected to an array of varying extremes in a very short period of time, during and after which it must still successfully control its orientation, avoid tumbling, detach its trunk section, and deploy a series of parachutes to achieve a fully-successful test. Additionally, the In-Flight Abort test will see Crew Dragon launch on an almost orbit-worthy Falcon 9 upper stage (lacking only a functional Merlin Vacuum engine) and thrice-flown booster B1046.

Five minutes later, Falcon 9 officially completed its mission by gently releasing Kacific-1/JCSAT-18 from the second stage, where the satellite shortly reoriented itself, deployed ~40-meter (~125 ft) long solar \u2018wings\u2019, and began verifying its systems\u2019 health.", "Aside from another successful and issue-free launch under the Falcon family\u2019s belt, the Kacific-1 mission is significant for another major reason: it\u2019s Falcon 9\u2019s 49th consecutively-successful launch since January 2017. Falcon 9\u2019s last catastrophic failure occurred on September 1st, 2016 when the rocket\u2019s upper stage violently exploded, destroying the rest of the rocket and its Amos-6 satellite payload. ", "SpaceX took approximately four months to determine the root cause of that failure and modify hardware and procedures accordingly before returning to flight with the first Iridium NEXT launch on January 14th, 2017. In the three years (35 months) since then, Falcon 9 has successfully launched a total of 49 times in a row without even a partial failure. After one additional launch success, Falcon 9 will have flown 50 consecutively-successful missions, a symbolic but still exceptional sign of the rocket\u2019s excellent reliability. That 50th launch attempt could come as early as December 30th in the form of SpaceX\u2019s third 60-satellite Starlink mission, known as Starlink-2.

Atlas V experienced another in-flight anomaly in 2016, although it was not technically classified as a partial failure.", "This means that Ariane 5, Delta IV, and Atlas V \u2013 still some of the most reliable launch vehicles ever built \u2013 have technically only performed 9, 36, and 70 (or 18) consecutively-successful launches since their most recent partial failure (or in-flight anomaly). In other words, if measured in terms of uninterrupted consecutive launch successes, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 is either the most reliable or the second most reliable launch vehicle currently in operation.", "Perhaps even more impressive is the fact that SpaceX has pulled off that feat of reliability in less than three years, unequivocally making Falcon 9 the best all-purpose launch vehicle in the world in terms of its combined reliability and flight frequency \u2013 the latter thanks in large part to the rocket\u2019s exceptionally competitive pricing.

The pressure wave that failure created damaged almost every internal component of the massive vehicle, all but guaranteeing that SpaceX would have to scrap the vehicle and move on to new prototypes.", "Those future prototypes will take advantage of the many, many lessons learned from Starhopper\u2019s two test flights and several additional grounded tests, as well as the many learning experiences presented through Starship Mk1\u2019s pathfinder manufacturing, assembly, and test campaign. As is SpaceX\u2019s signature, the company is choosing to learn by building actual hardware and making the inevitable mistakes that come hand in hand with such an eccentric and ambitious program.", "Above all else, SpaceX is trying to redefine the minimum infrastructure needed to build high-performance launch vehicles at a scale comparable to or even larger than NASA\u2019s Saturn V, the largest rocket ever successfully launched. Modern rockets like Falcon 9 and Atlas V are built in relatively clean and environmentally-controlled environments and Saturn I and V \u2013 while quite a bit less sterile \u2013 were at least built inside large hangar-like facilities. ", "With Starship, SpaceX instead wants to build rockets even larger than Saturn V out in the elements and with a far more common (and thus affordable) workforce, (theoretically) made possible in large part thanks to its extensive use of stainless steel. Case in point, Starhopper \u2013 a low-fidelity Starship test bed \u2013 was quite literally welded together on the South Texas coast by welders far more familiar with building water towers. While not without its teething pains, Starhopper proved to be incredibly sturdy and resistant to anomalous behavior and successfully performed two separate flight tests in July and August 2019.", "Three months after Starhopper\u2019s second and final hop test, SpaceX\u2019s Starship Mk1 tank section \u2013 the lower half of the rocket \u2013 was moved to the launch site and began a series of tanking tests. The first few tests were completed successfully and focused on searching for leaks with a neutral cryogenic liquid (likely liquid nitrogen). After the majority of those leaks were sealed, SpaceX moved into liquid oxygen load testing a few days later. For unconfirmed reasons, it turned out that that first liquid oxygen pressure test would also be Starship Mk1\u2019s last.", "On November 20th, SpaceX pressurized Starship Mk1 to its limits, with almost all of the visible creases and wrinkles in its steel surface visibly smoothing out as the supercool liquid oxygen caused frost to form on the exterior. Ultimately, SpaceX pushed the vehicle beyond its limits and its uppermost tank dome quite literally popped off of Starship\u2019s tank section, whether the overpressure event was intentional or unexpected. The force of that overpressure event essentially sent a shockwave through Starship, crushing and warping its two remaining tank domes and transfer tubes like an aluminum soda can.", "In simpler terms, very few parts of Starship Mk1 escaped unharmed, all but guaranteeing that it would not be worth the effort to repair it. Instead, SpaceX has almost entirely scrapped the prototype over a period of two weeks. According to an official statement released shortly after Mk1\u2019s failure, SpaceX will attempt to recover and reuse as much of Mk1 as it can and those few salvageable parts will be added to an entirely new prototype, deemed Starship Mk3.", "Although it\u2019s disappointing that Starship Mk1 was unable to perform any kind of Raptor engine testing, let alone flight tests, it\u2019s safe to say that the pathfinder prototype has been well worth the time and effort it took to build. Regardless of flight or engine testing, a ton of Mk1\u2019s value lies in its utility as a hands-on, physical testbed for SpaceX employees to perform experiments and learn how to build steel rockets \u2013 and build them outside in less than friendly weather conditions.", "SpaceX is in the midst of rapidly expanding its presence in Boca Chica, Texas, including a new launch control center, an expanded landing and launch pad, new production facilities, and more. The company has also just begun churning out numerous monolithic (single-weld) steel rings that will likely become part of Starship Mk3 in the near future. It will likely be several months before that next-generation prototype is as close to completion as Starship Mk1 was, but it should be well worth the wait and well worth its predecessor\u2019s sacrifice.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

Her recovered fairing half is somewhat awkwardly strewn on the deck with no obvious attempt to rectify the issue, indicating that the net may have torn mid-lift, causing the fairing to fall maybe 5-10 feet.", "If it did actually fall onto Ms. Tree\u2019s deck, that will almost certainly be visible in the form of damage to its aluminum-composite honeycomb structure and white insulation coating.", "Ultimately, fairing recovery continues to prove itself to be a major challenge, although SpaceX obviously has no intention of giving up. With two successful catches already in hand, it\u2019s clear that fairing recovery is undeniably possible and is more a matter of tweaking existing systems than starting from scratch. Much like Falcon 9 booster recovery had and its fair share of failed landings even after the first success, it will likely take quite a while for SpaceX to optimize fairing recovery to the point that it can be considered reliable.

In fact, at least as a very rough approximation, the helicopter\u2019s descent may be useful to judge the fairing\u2019s behavior while gliding: taking ~14 minutes to travel descend 11,000ft and travel perhaps 2 miles (~10,500ft) horizontally, the fairing would dropped\u00a0at a reasonable 13.1 feet per second (~4 m/s) once its parafoil opened and seemed to travel approximately one foot forward for every one foot down, also known as a 1:1 glide slope ratio.", "Depending on wind conditions, parafoils can nominally be expected to achieve average\u00a0glide slope ratios between 0 (high winds; falling like a literal rock) and 4 (no winds; almost as good as a bad airplane), meaning that Falcon fairings \u2013 judging from tangential data gathered from the helicopter following its descent \u2013 fly much like a parafoil, which is to say not great but better than a brick. The trick with parafoil control \u2013 which includes tweaking angles of attack and glide slope \u2013 lies more in the art of trading forward velocity for vertical velocity (or vice versa) at key moments. Assuming their control mechanisms have enough authority, paragliding fairings could \u2018flare\u2019 as they near Mr. Steven\u2019s net, essentially angling upwards to briefly hover before dropping quickly, maybe giving the boat enough time to swoop in and place its net just beneath it.", "In this way, a parafoil\u2019s flexible, inflated wing (airfoil, to be precise) can allow it to maneuver quite a lot like a bird, at least more so than most other methods of flying humans have access to. Time will tell if SpaceX is having any luck perfecting the guidance and recovery of Falcon fairings, particularly with this campaign of under-the-radar drop tests.

Indeed, just three firm launch contracts over the next two years did not bode particularly well for Falcon Heavy as a competitive complement to SpaceX\u2019s commercial launch business \u2013 without regular demand and assuming a competitive and fixed-price market, the cost of maintaining the infrastructure needed to build and fly a distinct launch vehicle will inevitably end up cannibalizing profitability or even the ability to break even.", "For vehicles like ULA\u2019s Delta IV Heavy, NASA\u2019s SLS, or the late Space Shuttle, the unique capabilities offered by certain low-volume rockets or even just the risk of faltering can lead to situations where anchor customers will swallow huge cost premiums for the sake of simply preserving those capabilities. In non-competitive markets, it does not take much for nearly any capability to become essentially priceless. SpaceX, however, paid for Falcon Heavy\u2019s development without seeking \u2013 and even actively turning down \u2013 most government development funding or guaranteed launch contracts.", "As such, Falcon Heavy\u2019s utility and existence are in a far more precarious position than most rockets, owing to the fact that SpaceX would likely not hesitate to kill the vehicle if commercial demand rapidly\u00a0withered to nothing, far from impossible with just three total launches contracted over a period of fewer than two years. Prior to the USAF announcing a new Falcon Heavy launch contract in June 2018, that number was just two secured launches. Combined with the USAF purchase, Ozvon\u2019s\u00a0new contract suggests that prospects for the super-heavy-lift rocket may be at least warm enough to sustain its useful existence.", "There is also a decent chance that, once Falcon Heavy has proven itself with one or two real satellite launches, commercial launch customers will warm to its impressive capabilities. Most notably, Ozvon may have sided with Falcon Heavy solely because the powerful rocket can place its Ozvon-3 communications satellite\u00a0", "directly", " into geostationary orbit (GEO), compared to the far more common process of launching the satellite roughly halfway there and letting it finish the journey on its own, known as geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) insertion.", "There is undoubtedly significant commercial upside for geostationary communications satellites to arrive at their operational orbits as quickly as possible, rather than spending weeks or even months slowly making their way uphill from GTO. The cost of dedicated launches of Delta IV Heavy or Ariane 5 have far outweighed the benefits of earlier operability for as long as the rockets have been flying, though, and smaller and more affordable vehicles like Falcon 9, Atlas 5, or dual-manifested Ariane 5s simply aren\u2019t powerful enough to launch traditionally-sized commsats\u00a0directly to GEO.", "\u00a0", "In that regard, Falcon Heavy launches\u00a0", "could", " become a commercial game changer and a distinct competitive advantage for companies that select it.

What is less clear is whether the rocket burst before or after reaching its theoretical design limit.", "For reference, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket operates with its fuel and oxygen tanks pressurized to about 50 psi (3.5 atm) with localized pressures likely doubling or tripling near the bottom of both tanks during the first minute or two of launch. Some amateur back-of-the-envelope calculations from videos of Starship Mk1\u2019s burst event suggest that it was pressurized to at least 60-75 psi (4-5 atm) at its upper tank dome, meaning that the pressure on its two lower domes and tank walls would have been even higher. If correct, those unofficial figures mean that Mk1 actually performed quite well considering the ramshackle facilities and unprecedentedly spartan methods used to fabricate and assemble it.", "As such, Musk likely considers Starship\u2019s tank domes the \u201cmost difficult part of [its] primary structure\u201d in large part because of how difficult it is to make giant propellant tank domes simultaneously light and strong. Musk has previously implied that Starship Mk1 was more 200 tons (450,000 lb) empty while the ultimate goal for the spacecraft\u2019s empty weight is closer to 120 tons, and a large portion of that weight savings will likely have to come from making its tank domes as light as possible.", "In line with that educated speculation, the last month or so of SpaceX\u2019s Starship work in Boca Chica, Texas has been marked by a distinct focus on building tank domes. In fact, Musk himself tweeted that he had worked all night with SpaceX engineers in Boca Chica in a bid to get dome production ready for Starship\u2019s Mk3 prototype, the first Super Heavy hardware, and many more rockets to come.", "Prior to Musk\u2019s tweet, a Starship tank dome was actually shipped all the way from Florida to Texas and arrived earlier this month.

Additionally, Starlink v1.0 satellites were said to feature antennas with twice as many steerable beams, meaning that they can effectively serve two times as many regions simultaneously. It\u2019s unclear if the addition of Ka-band antennas is the sole source of these substantial improvements.", "Furthermore, during the Starlink v0.9 launch, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated that the 60 satellites represented a bandwidth of more than 1 terabit per second (Tbps), translating to ~17 Gbps per satellite. More likely than not, Musk was speaking aspirational and the v0.9 satellites actually represented more like ~200-300 Gbps worth of throughput, with the additional of Ka-band antennas and perhaps general technology upgrades bringing v1.0 satellites to a nominal ~17 Gbps apiece.", "For now, 60 Starlink v1.0 satellites are now in orbit and are rapidly spreading out after their bizarre but effective blob-style deployment.

Soon after that, frost began to appear on the exterior of its steel liquid oxygen and methane tanks, a telltale sign that some form of cryogenic testing was ongoing. Based on a distinct lack of activity at the nearby flare stack, SpaceX was using liquid oxygen (LOX) or liquid nitrogen (LN2) to verify that Starship performs as expected when filled with supercool propellant.", "After initial venting and visible frost formation, SpaceX appeared to push forward, rapidly loading Starship Mk1 with LOX or LN2. This progress was easily visible thanks to the fact that the mass and pressure of all that cryogenic liquid made quick work of the slight imperfections on the exterior of Starship\u2019s steel hull, turning the vehicle\u2019s reflection from a speckled patchwork to an almost mirror-like finish. Roughly half an hour later, the otherwise peaceful scene was interrupted by the rapid failure of Starship Mk1\u2019s upper LOX tank dome, instantly thrown several hundred feet into the air.", "Seconds later, the crumpled upper half of Starship Mk1\u2019s tank section appeared out of the clouds created and began hemorrhaging a huge volume of liquid oxygen, immediately boiling and vaporizing as it was exposed to the Earth\u2019s comparatively white-hot atmosphere. Impressively, Starship appeared to remain functional after its top quite literally blew off, and the vehicle rapidly detanked and appeared to safe itself. Some ten minutes after the overpressure event, the freed liquid oxygen had boiled to nothing and Starship appeared to be quiet.", "By all appearances, Starship Mk1 appeared to perform extremely well as an integrated system up to the point that its upper tank dome failed. The first frame from LabPadre\u2019s stream with anything visibly amiss explicitly implicates the weld connecting the LOX dome to the cylindrical body of Starship\u2019s LOX tank, point to a bad weld joint as the likeliest source of the failure. Although that hardware failure is unfortunate, Mk1\u2019s loss will hopefully guide improvements in Starship\u2019s design and manufacturing procedures. ", "Minutes after the anomaly was broadcast on several unofficial livestreams of SpaceX\u2019s Boca Chica facilities, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged Starship Mk1\u2019s failure in a tweet, telegraphing a general lack of worry. Of note, Musk indicated that Mk1 was valuable mainly as a manufacturing pathfinder, entirely believable but also partially contradicting his September 2019 presentation, in which he pretty clearly stated that Mk1 would soon be launched to ~20 km to demonstrate Starship\u2019s exotic new skydiver landing strategy.", "Musk says that instead of repairing Starship Mk1, SpaceX\u2019s Boca Chica team will move directly to Starship Mk3, a significantly more advanced design that has benefitted from the numerous lessons learned from building and flying Starhopper and fabricating Starship Mk1. The first Starship Mk3 ring appears to have already been prepared, but SpaceX\u2019s South Texas focus has clearly been almost entirely on preparing Starship Mk1 for wet dress rehearsal, static fire, and flight tests. After today\u2019s failure, it sounds like Mk1 will most likely be retired early and replaced as soon as possible by Mk3. ", "Above all else, the most important takeaway from today\u2019s Starship Mk1 anomaly is that the vehicle was a very early prototype and SpaceX likely wants to have vehicle failures occur on the ground or in-flight. As long as no humans are at risk, pushing Starship to failure (or suffering unplanned failures like today\u2019s) can only serve to benefit and improve the vehicle\u2019s design, especially when the failed hardware can be recovered intact (ish) and carefully analyzed. ", "A step further, SpaceX is simultaneously building a second (and third) Starship prototype at its companion Cocoa, Florida facilities, and Starship Mk2 is nearly finished. Coincidentally, technicians installed its last tank dome \u2013 the same dome that failed on Mk1 \u2013 just days ago, and any insight that the Boca Chica team can gather from Mk1\u2019s troubles will almost certainly be applied to Mk2, whether that means reinforcing its existing domes or fully replacing the upper dome with an improved design.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

", "Offering more than 50 pages of detailed analysis of behavior that was at best inept and at worst deeply corrupt, OIG\u2019s analysis uncovered some uncomfortable revelations about NASA\u2019s relationship with Boeing in a different realm than usual: NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program (CCP). Begun in the 2010s in an effort to develop multiple redundant commercial alternatives to the Space Shuttle, prematurely canceled before a US alternative was even on the horizon, the CCP ultimately awarded SpaceX and Boeing major development contracts in September 2014. ", "NASA awarded fixed-cost contracts worth $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion to Boeing and SpaceX, respectively, to essentially accomplish the same goals: design, build, test, and fly new spacecraft capable of transporting NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). The intention behind fixed-price contracts was to hold contractors responsible for any delays they might incur over the development of human-rated spacecraft, a task NASA acknowledged as challenging but far from unprecedented.", "The most likely trigger of the bizarre events that would unfold a few years down the road began in part on June 28th, 2015 and culminated on September 1st, 2016, the dates of the two catastrophic failures SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket has suffered since its 2010 debut. In the most generous possible interpretation of the OIG\u2019s findings, NASA headquarters and CCP managers may have been shaken and not thinking on an even keel after SpaceX\u2019s second major failure in a little over a year.", "Under this stress, the agency may have ignored common sense and basic contracting due-diligence, leading \u201cnumerous officials\u201d to sign off on a plan that would subvert Boeing\u2019s fixed-price contract, paying the company an additional $287 million (~7%) to prevent a perceived gap in NASA astronaut access to the ISS. This likely arose because NASA briefly believed that SpaceX\u2019s failures could cause multiple years of delays, making Boeing the only available crew transport provider for a significant period of time. Starliner was already delayed by more than a year, making it increasingly unlikely that Boeing ", "alone", " would be able to ensure continuous NASA access to the ISS.", "As NASA attempted to argue in its response to the audit, \u201cthe final price [increase] was agreed to by NASA and Boeing and was reviewed and approved by numerous NASA officials at the Kennedy Space Center and Headquarters\u201d. In the heat of the moment, perhaps those officials forgot that Boeing had already purchased several Russian Soyuz seats to sell to NASA or tourists, and perhaps those officials missed the simple fact that those seats and some elementary schedule tweaks could have almost entirely alleviated the perceived \u201caccess gap\u201d with minimal cost and effort.", "The OIG audit further implied that the timing of a Boeing proposal \u2013 submitted just days after NASA agreed to pay the company extra to prevent that access gap \u2013 was suspect.", "\u201cFive days after NASA committed to pay $287.2 million in price increases for four commercial crew missions, Boeing submitted an official proposal to sell NASA up to five Soyuz seats for $373.5 million for missions during the same time period.

The very next week, Boeing asked NASA if it wanted to buy five Soyuz seats it had already acquired to send NASA astronauts to the ISS. ", "Bluntly speaking, this series of events has three obvious explanations, none of them particularly reassuring.", "The latter explanation, while possibly the worst and most corruption-laden, is arguably the likeliest choice based on the history of NASA\u2019s relationship with Boeing. In fact, a July 2019 report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed that NASA was consistently paying Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of \u201caward fees\u201d as part of the company\u2019s SLS booster (core stage) production contract, which is no less than four years behind schedule and $1.8 billion over budget. From 2014 to 2018, NASA awarded Boeing a total of $271M in award fees, a practice meant to award a given contractor\u2019s excellent performance.

This is to say that \u201cnumerous NASA officials\u201d were also presumably more than happy to give Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars in awards even as the company was and is clearly a big reason why the SLS program continues to fail to deliver.", "Ultimately, although NASA\u2019s concern about SpaceX\u2019s back-to-back Falcon 9 failures and some combination of ineptitude, ignorance, and corruption all clearly played a role, the fact remains that NASA \u2013 according to the inspector general \u2013 ", "never", " approached SpaceX as part of their 2016/2017 efforts to prevent a \u2018crew access gap\u2019. Given that the CCP has two partners, that decision was highly improper regardless of the circumstances and is made even more inexplicable by the fact that NASA was apparently well aware that SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon had significantly shorter lead times and far lower costs compared to Starliner. ", "This would have meant that had NASA approached SpaceX to attempt to mitigate the access gap, SpaceX could have almost certainly done it significantly cheaper and faster, or at minimum injected a bit of good-faith competition into the endeavor.", "Finally and perhaps most disturbingly of all, NASA OIG investigators were told by \u201cseveral NASA officials\u201d that \u2013 in spite of several preferable alternatives \u2013 they ultimately chose to sign off Boeing\u2019s demanded price increases because they were worried that Boeing would ", "quit the Commercial Crew Program entirely", " without it.

Those first vents came after roughly an hour or two spent performing several different pressurization cycles, observable due to the fact that Starship\u2019s stainless steel tanks visibly smoothed out as pressure increased. ", "Due to the typical distances Starship is viewed from and the nature of the mirror-finished stainless steel SpaceX has chosen to build the next-generation launch vehicle out of, the exterior of Starship prototypes can produce a reflection that looks bumpy and disjointed. This has lead many a layperson to incorrectly assume that SpaceX\u2019s Starship prototypes are thus shoddily built. In reality, viewed from afar, the tiniest hint of surface heterogeneity on a mirror can dramatically change what is reflected on its surface. ", "Even at the thinness of Starship Mk1\u2019s liquid oxygen and methane tanks, stainless steel is still extremely strong, but pressurizing the vehicle\u2019s tanks can clearly counteract a significant portion of the slight imperfections in their curvature. ", "Although it\u2019s now clear that SpaceX did in fact perform some kind of pressurization test with Starship Mk1, it remains to be seen what exactly the nature of that testing was. First and foremost, SpaceX did establish significant roadblocks almost six hours before testing began, and company workers vacated the launch site several hours before visible Starship pressurization and venting. Fairly soon after that vent, workers returned to the pad and may or may not have been present during additional (but more subdued) venting activity.", "Most importantly, November 18th\u2019s testing featured a sum total of zero visible activity at SpaceX\u2019s nearby flare stack, a mechanism used to burn waste methane gas to prevent dangerous buildups at worksites (or launch pads). This almost certainly means that methane (gaseous or liquid) played no role in pressurizing Starship Mk1\u2019s propellant tanks. ", "Altogether, that likely means that Monday\u2019s proof test was not a wet dress rehearsal (WDR), a term used to describe the process of testing a launch vehicle by fully fueling it and performing a countdown identical to a real launch \u2013 but without engine ignition or liftoff. Instead, SpaceX likely began the day\u2019s testing by pressurizing Starship several times with a neutral gas like nitrogen or helium, while gaseous oxygen is also a possibility but is significantly less likely. Simply by using pressure sensors on Starship and knowing the volume of gas that is being loaded, SpaceX could likely determine whether the prototype has any leaks.", "The major vent around 6 pm local time could have simply been Starship venting that pressurant gas, which would explain why there was just a single large, observable vent. When dealing with cryogenic liquid propellant, those supercool liquids gradually heat up, causing a portion to boil and turn into gas, gas that launch vehicles then vent intermittently to prevent overpressure events (i.e. explosions). Starship Mk1 only visibly vented once, although there may have also been some additional venting even after technicians returned to the launch site (another sign that the pressurant was neither toxic or combustible).", "Oddly, shortly after SpaceX workers returned to the launch pad, they appeared to begin spraying down Starship Mk1 with a large volume of water or foam, producing clouds of mist as large as Starship itself. This came as a total surprise and why it\u2019s being done is entirely unclear. Possible explanations include simply rinsing Starship (but why and why ", "now", "?), checking its tanks for leaks, applying industrial quantities of WD40 (used to protect stainless steel from rust), or maybe even testing how Starship stands up to ice (extremely unlikely as it would need to be filled with a cryogenic liquid to be cold enough).", "Perhaps the morning light will bring some answers. All things considered, as long as the mysterious spraying is not indicative of any serious issues or concerns with Starship Mk1, SpaceX may now be ready to put the prototype through a true propellant loading test, potentially filling its tanks with as much as 1200 metric tons (2.65 million pounds) of liquid oxygen and methane.

In 2011, he departed NASA and joined SpaceX, where he lead the development of the GNC technology needed to successfully and reliably recovery Falcon 9 boosters.

In his recent interview with University of Cambridge staff, Lars revealed that his role as Principal Mars Landing Engineer involved a far wider scope than his previous GNC-centered work, with the goal instead being to design a launch vehicle (Starship) from the ground up to be easily recovered and reused.

It\u2019s not clear that Starship Mk1 is \u2013 at present \u2013 capable of performing a wet dress rehearsal (WDR), a common aerospace test where a rocket is fully fueled and counts down to launch without actually igniting.", "Instead, SpaceX could potentially perform a pressure (or at least leak) test with a neutral gas (or perhaps liquid nitrogen) just to verify that Starship Mk1 is structurally sound before kicking off cryogenic propellant loading. Additionally, it\u2019s possible that SpaceX could get around Mk1\u2019s incomplete propellant feed lines by attaching pad umbilicals directly to the ends of the incomplete feed lines.", "At the same time, it\u2019s possible that SpaceX has decided to finish assembling Starship at the launch pad itself, hinted at when a local photographer captured a number of Mk1\u2019s control surfaces and aero covers being moved around shortly after Starship was moved to the pad.

Alongside NASA\u2019s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, Commercial Crew continues to be a major priority for NASA and is equally prominent in NAC meetings, where program officials present updates.", "On October 30th, CCP manager Kathy Lueders presented one such update on the progress being made by Commercial Crew providers Boeing and SpaceX, both of which are just weeks away from multiple crucial tests. Boeing is scheduled to perform a pad abort test of its Starliner spacecraft as early as November 4th, while SpaceX is targeting a static fire of a Crew Dragon capsule on November 6th. If that test fire is successful, the same capsule could be ready to support SpaceX\u2019s In-Flight Abort (IFA) test in early-December, and Boeing\u2019s Starliner could attempt its orbital launch debut (OFT) no earlier than (NET) December 17th.", "For both SpaceX and Boeing, the results of their respective In-Flight Abort and Orbital Flight Test will determine just how soon NASA will certify each company to attempt their first commercial launches with astronauts aboard. If Boeing\u2019s Pad Abort goes perfectly and Starliner\u2019s NET December 17th OFT is also a total success, the company could be ready for its Crewed Flight Test (CFT) anywhere from 3-6+ months after (March-June 2020). ", "If SpaceX\u2019s IFA test goes perfectly next month, Crew Dragon\u2019s Demo-2 astronaut launch could occur as early as February or March 2020. In April 2019, SpaceX suffered a major setback when flight-proven Crew Dragon capsule C201 violently exploded milliseconds before a planned abort thruster static fire test, reducing the historic spacecraft to a field of debris. Before that failure, C201 had been assigned to perform the in-flight abort test, while capsule C205 was in the late stages of assembly for Demo-2.", "Had that explosion never happened and the C201 IFA gone perfectly, Demo-2 could have potentially been ready for launch as early as August or September 2019. Instead, C201\u2019s demise forced SpaceX to change capsule assignments, reassigning C205 to support Crew Dragon\u2019s IFA, while C206 was moved to Demo-2. Nevertheless, as both SpaceX and NASA officials have noted, C201\u2019s on-pad explosion has been viewed as a gift, for the most part, as the capsule failed in a largely controlled and highly-instrumented environment. ", "In fact, NASA manager Kathy Lueders complimented NASA\u2019s involvement in the anomaly resolution process and repeatedly praised SpaceX\u2019s response to Dragon\u2019s explosion. Although the explosion was an undesirable result, SpaceX\u2019s relentless prioritization flight hardware testing prevented a failure from occurring in flight. Performed alongside NASA, SpaceX\u2019s subsequent investigations and experimentation have essentially brought to light a new design constraint, the knowledge of which many space agencies and companies will likely benefit from.", "Most notably, however, Lueders detailed how impressed she was at the incredible speed with which SpaceX was able to respond to Crew Dragon\u2019s catastrophic static fire anomaly.", "\u201cSo the nice thing is that the SpaceX folks had a bunch of vehicles in flow.

For example, Boeing\u2019s Starliner service module \u2013 generally less complex than the crew capsule \u2013 suffered a serious anomaly during a June 2018 static fire test. As a result, Boeing had to fully replace the service module with new hardware and repeat the same test before it could proceed to Starliner\u2019s Pad Abort, at the time expected a few weeks later (Q2 2018). ", "Like SpaceX, Boeing was forced to cannibalize future launch hardware to re-attempt its static fire test, which was ultimately completed some 11 months after the anomaly on May 24th, 2019.

If, for example, SpaceX ends up spending $100-200 million developing fairing recovery, it will take a bare minimum of 15-30+ flawless recoveries (of both halves, no less) to recoup the company\u2019s investment. ", "Still, given that SpaceX will need no fewer than 75-190+ dedicated Falcon 9 launches to orbit its entire licensed Starlink constellation, it\u2019s not surprising that the company has deemed the investment and major challenges worth it. While the payload fairing only represents 10% of the cost of a new Falcon 9, accounting for the booster reuse that is more or less guaranteed on all Starlink missions means that the fairing could actually represent more like 30%+ of the cost to SpaceX for each internal Starlink launch.", "Ultimately, even on the low end of Starlink\u2019s required Falcon 9 launches, recovering and reusing payload fairings could save SpaceX hundreds of millions of dollars. Not only that, reliable fairing recovery would mean that SpaceX can close the recovery loop on both Falcon 9 boosters and fairings, representing some 75-80% of the rocket\u2019s total cost. In other words, recovering fairings could allow SpaceX to lower the cost of launch to something like $15 or $20M for each Starlink mission \u2014 simply inconceivable and definitely unbeatable for more than 15 metric tons (33,000 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO).", "Meanwhile, some 35 minutes before Ms. Tree caught her third Falcon fairing, Falcon 9 booster B1051 nailed its third drone ship landing in 10 months, setting the rocket up for a fourth launch and landing sometime in the near future.

When Musk revealed that SpaceX would move from carbon fiber to steel in December 2018, the CEO went into some detail to explain several of those challenges and why the major change was thus worth the substantial body of work it would force the company to scrap and redo from scratch.", "The two biggest hurdles for BFR were quite simple. From a technical perspective, carbon fiber is dramatically less temperature-resistant than most metals (especially steel), meaning that despite it offering a much higher strength-to-weight ratio on paper, almost every inch of the spaceship and booster\u2019s exposed surfaces would have to be insulated. For Starship, this would be exceptionally challenging given that the spacecraft must fundamentally be able to survive numerous orbital-velocity reentries with little to no refurbishment in between. While a steel Starship would still need a proper heat shield on its windward half, the other half of its steel hull could likely be almost entirely unshielded thanks to the fact that most steels remain structural sound at much higher temperatures.", "Beyond the ", "\u201cdelightfully counterintuitive\u201d", " technical properties that could make a steel Starship as light or even lighter than the carbon composite alternative, Musk also noted that a huge motivator for the switch was the fact that the cutting-edge composites SpaceX would have to buy were ", "incredibly", " expensive.

Perhaps just a few hundred meters above the ground, Starship will finally perform an aggressive flip maneuver, igniting its Raptors while sideways, swerving to neutralize that horizontal velocity, and finally landing on six small legs.", "In this sense, although they certainly look the part, Starship\u2019s aerodynamic control surfaces are very explicitly ", "not", " wings and are instead meant to interact with the atmosphere at an almost 90-degree angle of attack (AoA).

A WDR would see SpaceX load Starship as if preparing for launch (requiring liquid oxygen, methane, nitrogen, and helium) but stopping just prior to the engine ignition and liftoff that would otherwise follow. Although unlikely, a WDR could result in a massive fire or explosion if Starship were to lose structural integrity during the test, which is why the aforementioned neutral testing is typically performed first when handling brand new launch vehicles.", "Finally, assuming Starship Mk1 successfully passes the above tests, SpaceX will use the vehicle to perform Raptor\u2019s first triple-engine static fire test.

Twenty seconds or so later, the Falcon 9 booster rapidly shut down its landing engine, visibly falling several feet onto the deck of drone ship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY).", "The results of that unintentionally hard landing are extremely apparent in photos taken of the same booster after its first (March 2019) and third (Jan 2020) landings on drone ship OCISLY, compared above. Taken from almost identical perspectives as the drone ship passed through the mouth of Port Canaveral, the difference in the booster\u2019s height and stance are hard to miss, with B1051\u2019s engine bells and the black \u2018belt\u2019 of its heat-shielded engine section clearly sitting several feet lower after Starlink V1 L3.", "While subtle, the most important difference is near the tips of each visible landing leg\u2019s telescoping boom, visible in the form of a final, smaller cylinder on the left (earlier) image. On the right, that cylinder has effectively disappeared. This is actually an intentional feature of Falcon 9\u2019s landing leg design: known as a \u2018crush core\u2019, the tip of each leg boom holds a roughly 1m (3ft) long cylinder of aluminum honeycomb, optimized to lose structural integrity (crush) only after a specific amount of force is applied. In essence, those crush cores serve as dead-simple, single-use shock absorbers that can be reused as long as a given booster\u2019s landing is gentle enough.

Why B1051 fell onto the deck is unclear, potentially caused by the drone being at the bottom of a swell or a last-second anomaly with the booster\u2019s landing engine.

With challenges as complex as those faced in spaceflight, let alone massive, fully-reusable rockets like Starship, it\u2019s hard to be surprised that practical deadlines tend to be miles away from theoretically-possible minimums.", "As such, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to feel a bit like the townspeople with a boy crying wolf, but there are arguably several reasons for optimism, this time around. Most importantly, as partially pictured above, SpaceX has completed four intentionally destructive tests with full-scale Starship hardware in just the last 2.5 months. Deemed unfit for flight, SpaceX pressurized Starship Mk1 with liquid nitrogen until it burst in November 2019, reaching an estimated 3-5 bar (45-75 psi). ", "SpaceX spent the following month upgrading both the methods and facilities used to build Starship prototypes in South Texas \u2013 a process that is still very much ongoing. However, two recent tests of Starship tanks built with some of those new methods and facilities have unequivocally proven that great progress is being made. The first \u2018test tank\u2019 managed 7.1 bar (105 psi) before it burst, while a second tank completed less than three weeks later reached 7.5 bar (110 psi) with water and 8.5 bar (125 psi) with liquid nitrogen on January 28th. Between those tests, Musk revealed that 6 bar was the bare minimum necessary for orbital Starship flights, while 8.5 bar would potentially offer the safety margins needed for crewed Starship flights. ", "In other words, SpaceX\u2019s last two tank tests have effectively proved that \u2013 even with facilities and methods only partially upgraded \u2013 the company is ready to begin manufacturing the first truly flight-rated Starship prototypes. In response, Musk recently stated that he was going \u201cmax hardcore on\u201d Starship design and production in Boca Chica and revealed that SpaceX would host a second South Texas jobs fair in three weeks to help rapidly staff its growing rocket factory.", "Looking at the progress SpaceX has made in just the last week, it\u2019s hard to fault Musk\u2019s brimming enthusiasm. Now breaking in new semi-automated welding machines, upgraded production equipment, and two massive sprung structures (i.e. tents), SpaceX engineers and technicians are churning out improved steel rings, tank domes (bulkheads), smaller propellant tanks, and more at a breakneck pace relative to the last year of Starship work. Additionally, at least six of those new rings have been stacked together in two sections, likely representing the effective birth of the first flightworthy Starship \u2013 \u2018SN01\u2019.", "With SpaceX\u2019s new enclosed facilities, much of its South Texas work is now hidden. Still, from what\u2019s visible, it\u2019s safe to say that the company is well its way to completing the first flight \u2013 and possibly orbit \u2013 worthy Starship prototypes in the near future.", "Check out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters", "\u00a0for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes", "."]},

While there is some clear uncertainty given that the quality and consistency required for oil and gas needs or even simple water storage likely isn\u2019t the same needed to meet strict spaceflight margins, SpaceX has already acquired several production tools from existing contractors and is working around the clock to prove that those same tools can be used to build large, reusable rockets.", "The gamble is simple: if it turns out that off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment can become an almost turnkey solution for manufacturing high-quality Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy boosters, SpaceX may have found a shortcut to orbit, avoiding the huge expense of finding and building its own custom production solutions. But is that COTS tank fabrication hardware truly up to the task?", "At least right now, the simple answer is \u201cyes\u201d. Thanks to two highly successful destructive tests of Starship tank prototypes that wrapped up last month, SpaceX has confirmed that at least a subset of the available COTS solutions can be used to build Starships (theoretically) capable of orbital flight.
