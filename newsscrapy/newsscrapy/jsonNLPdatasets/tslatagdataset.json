According to the SEC\u2019s response, Musk must be held in contempt because his \u201creckless actions\u201d on social media have been \u201cstunning.\u201d", "The SEC filed its rebuttal of Musk\u2019s points on Monday, arguing that Musk has made no diligent or good faith effort to comply with the pre-approval provision of the court\u2019s order. The SEC also pointed out that none of Elon Musk\u2019s tweets since he reached a settlement with the agency last year were screened before they were posted online. ", "\u201cThe pre-approval requirement was designed to protect against reckless conduct by Musk going forward. It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the [contempt] motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect. Musk reads this Court\u2019s order as not requiring pre-approval unless Musk himself unilaterally decides his planned tweets are material. His interpretation is inconsistent with the plain terms of this Court\u2019s order and renders its pre-approval requirement meaningless\u201d the agency wrote. ", "The agency also argues that Musk\u2019s February 19 tweet, where he noted that Tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles in 2019, was material information to Tesla and its shareholders. The agency added that the frequency of Tesla\u2019s references to its production forecast in its public statements is proof that such statements are ", "material for the company", ". \u00a0", "\u201cMusk\u2019s recognition of the significance of Tesla\u2019s vehicle production forecasts to investors is evidenced by the frequency with which he and Tesla highlight such forecasts in their public statements. For years and continuing through the company\u2019s most recent earnings release, Tesla and Musk have prominently featured vehicle production forecasts in their public communications, including Tesla\u2019s investor letters, Musk\u2019s tweets, and the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. While some companies emphasize forward-looking guidance on financial metrics such as revenue and earnings per share, Tesla often highlights guidance regarding expected production rates and deliveries. Given this focus on Tesla\u2019s production capabilities, Musk cannot credibly argue that his statement, as Tesla\u2019s CEO, that the company \u2018will make around 500k\u2019 cars in 2019 could not have reasonably contained information material to Tesla and its investors,\u201d the SEC argued.  ", "The SEC further argued that Musk\u2019s tweet was different from the previous public disclosures. Tesla\u2019s Q4 2018 and Full Year Update Letter noted that the company is expecting to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, though Musk later pointed out in the earnings call that Tesla is aiming to produce around \u201cmaybe in the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s\u201d this 2019. The SEC does not recognize Musk\u2019s statement in the earnings call.

Therefore, Musk was required to obtain pre-approval before he published this statement.", "\u201cPrior to the 7:15 tweet, Tesla had not publicly disclosed any forecast of the total number of vehicles it expected to produce in 2019. This should end the Court\u2019s inquiry as to whether Musk\u2019s failure to seek pre-approval constituted a violation of the Court\u2019s order. In the absence of an affirmative forecast on this important topic, Musk\u2019s tweet contained new information that could reasonably have been material to Tesla and its shareholders.", "\u201cTesla had, however, previously provided a clear forecast of total vehicle deliveries in 2019. Specifically, Tesla\u2019s January 30, 2019 Fourth Quarter & Full Year Update (\u2018Update Letter\u2019) stated, \u201cIn total, we are expecting to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019 . . . .\u201d Tesla included the same delivery forecast in the pre-approved talking points for its January 30 earnings call. Evidently at a loss as to how to explain the material difference between the company\u2019s repeated deliveries guidance and his 7:15 tweet, Musk\u2019s brief does not even mention the deliveries guidance. ", "\u201cInstead, Musk argues that his tweet could not reasonably have been material because Tesla previously stated that it was \u2018targeting\u2019 an annualized production rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between Q4 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020. This guidance was also given in Tesla\u2019s 2018 Form 10-K and during Tesla\u2019s January 30 earnings call. But this was a qualified forecast (\u2018targeting\u2019) of Tesla\u2019s expected achievement of a production run rate (not of aggregate production) for a particular vehicle line at some future point in time (somewhere between late 2019 and the middle of 2020). On its face, the 7:15 tweet\u2014which stated that Tesla will make around 500,000 cars in 2019\u2014was materially different from Tesla\u2019s production rate forecasts for Model 3.\u201d", "The release of the SEC\u2019s response to Elon Musk\u2019s stance would likely cause more volatility for Tesla and the performance of its stock (", "NASDAQ:TSLA", ").

In a conversation with ", "Teslarati", ", the investor explained that while it is easy to make assumptions based on Tesla\u2019s Q1 2019 figures, there is simply not enough data to accurately and responsibly forecast Model 3 (and in extension, Model S and X) demand. Tesla\u2019s Q1 2019 data is nevertheless useful, as it reveals a series of factors that could shed light on what is happening to the electric car maker. ", "The economist notes that demand shocks could be transitory or permanent. Taxes, for example, normally have a permanent effect and natural disasters have a transitory one. But these shocks have different effects over time depending on whether a shock is sudden or expected. Understanding how demand normally reacts to these shocks is very important, as it provides clues at what could be expected to make informed assumptions about Q1. When a shock such as a ", "federal tax credit reduction", " comes, for example, its effect happens in three stages \u2014 given that consumers knew it was coming. Before the shock hits, demand generally increases (pulling demand), followed by a period where demand decreases by more than what could be considered a new equilibrium. Following these is another period where demand increases to reach a new equilibrium. Q1 most likely was the worst part of the second stage. ", "The backlog of Model 3 reservations was primarily used as a point against Tesla by critics, with an assumption suggesting that there will be no demand for the vehicle after the company clears out its initial batch of reservations. The economist argued that while Tesla\u2019s backlog is widely believed to be a factor impacting demand, such a factor would likely not be relevant in the bigger picture. \u201cGiven the characteristics of auto demand (it recycles constantly, consumers preferences are well understood, and trends are clear) a \u2018backlog\u2019 has the same effect as a natural disaster if you really want to compare it to something. If the backlog happens at the same time as a tax shock or other shocks, it just exacerbates the move. The duration of the shock could be discussed, but in the end, the effect of the backlog is just irrelevant,\u201d the investor said. ", "Tesla faced a number of shocks in the US auto market in recent months, and these could be translated into inaccurate assumptions. Among these are negative shocks such as the reduced federal tax credit, the \u201cend\u201d of the Model 3 reservation backlog, seasonality, and supply; as well as positive shocks like price reductions on the company\u2019s vehicle lineup. ", "\u201cThere are some main conclusions that one can infer from the data: 1) There isn\u2019t information available to know what the initial equilibrium was. The exponential shape of the curve gives no reference whatsoever to know this. Comparing Model S/X vs. Model 3, is easy to see that S/X had a stable path which would make it easier to measure the impact of these type of shocks; 2) Over time, the shock will be (almost) totally explained by the reduction in supply; 3) Shocks were expected, and price adjustments should more than cancel any negative permanent shock that taxes would have; and 4) Tesla had really bad luck with all these things happening at the same time,\u201d the economist remarked.", "Based on these data, one can infer that the primary constraint that Tesla is facing is ", "not demand, but supply", ". Demand for the company\u2019s vehicles is not exclusive to the United States auto market. It is global, and in this sense, there is simply no indication that global supply for Tesla\u2019s electric cars is already meeting global demand. The investor noted that the effect of the \u201cbacklog\u201d argument in global markets would likely be marginal and transitory, and just as demand is not static, supply and prices have not been either.", "Ultimately, the most significant factor that would affect the demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles is consumer preferences. In recent years, consumer preferences are changing in favor of smart devices, and this cascades into the auto industry. Tesla\u2019s electric cars, which are arguably the most tech-focused consumer vehicles on the road today, are a perfect fit for this changing landscape. ", "According to the economist, \u201cConsumer preferences and regulation actually affect demand. Prices technically don\u2019t affect demand \u2014 just the quantity demanded \u2014 and the trend shows that it will have a multiplier effect. It\u2019s always important to ask the correct questions, and the question today is not what are they doing to \u2018fix\u2019 a transitory shock? Or where\u2019s demand? The question is, how will you increase supply?\u201d", "In terms of the alleged cannibalization of Model S and X sales by the Model 3, the investor notes that there is no reason, at least at present, to believe that cannibalization is actually happening. Tesla Model 3 sales increased while Model S and X remained in their path, and as sales of the flagship sedan and SUV decreased, Model 3 sales in the US decreased as well. ", "\u201cEven if you disaggregate data to try to find signs of cannibalization, there\u2019s still no proof. There\u2019s only one market \u2014 Norway \u2014 that is big enough, that has reliable data and didn\u2019t face any distortions (tax or subsidy), that could give us any insight about cannibalization. Without further information, it would seem that there was significant cannibalization. The only problem is that Tesla distorted the market by eliminating the most popular Model S and X variant (75kWh), which was, on average 70%+ of sales. It is simply impossible to know which effect (the Model 3\u2019s introduction or the 75kWh variant\u2019s elimination) had the biggest impact, or even measure them in any way. And even then, one market may not be enough to prove it,\u201d the investor stated. ", "Ultimately, the continuing phase-out period of the federal tax credit in the US would likely affect Model S and X sales in the country. But similar to the Model 3, these effects will likely be transitory and not permanent, especially given that prices have changed accordingly, given that the vehicles have better value per dollar. As with the Model 3, the sharp decrease in Model S and X sales in Q1 2019 could be explained by supply changes in its totality. Thus, demand should return to its previous path after a short period of time. ", "Disclosure: I have no ownership in shares of TSLA and have no plans to initiate any positions within 72 hours."]},

Tesla commands a strong following, comprised of avid supporters and passionate critics alike.

With its unique combination of uncompromising performance, efficiency, and a reasonable price, the Model 3 has become a vehicle that constantly defies critics every step of the way.\u00a0", "The economist explained that consumers purchase vehicles according to preferences that are subject to budget constraints. The buying process then becomes a matter of selecting which car is the best option ", "within the confines of a budget", ". \u201cConsumers preferences can be easily understood when there is data available i.e when they clearly show what they want. With a car or any good for that matter, consumers are basically solving an ", "optimization", " problem. Hence, this is why advanced economic models \u2014 general equilibrium \u2014 are on essence an optimization problem,\u201d the economist wrote.\u00a0", "There are many variables that consumers consider when ", "purchasing a big-ticket item", " such as a car. Generally, there are no internal combustion vehicles that are as efficient as an electric car, but EVs prior to Teslas usually had worse performance and a higher price, which, in turn, discouraged buyers despite their lower total cost of ownership. Electric cars before the arrival of the original Tesla Roadster and the Model S also introduced a new constraint: range. Under these circumstances, it was not rare to see buyers who valued efficiency and/or are not price-sensitive selecting an EV, and those that valued performance and price opting for a petrol-powered car.\u00a0", "It is these very metrics that the Tesla Model 3 was able to completely address.

And this, according to the economist, has resonated with consumers. \u201cWhen Elon Musk says it\u2019s insane to buy something else other than a Tesla, it\u2019s because it literally is. You can prove it with math,\u201d the economist stated.\u00a0", "The researcher added that this is one of the key reasons why Tesla and the Model 3 have proven incredibly resilient despite the negative narrative surrounding the vehicle and the company as a whole.

Amidst the long-predicted entrance of competing vehicles from established automakers including Audi, Jaguar, and Porsche, Tesla\u2019s vehicles have proven to be vastly superior in range, as evidenced by the Model S Long Range, which can last 370 miles in between charges.\u00a0", "Take Tesla\u2019s very first car, the original Tesla Roadster. The vehicle featured Tesla\u2019s efforts at creating a desirable all-electric sports car, and it showed in the Roadster\u2019s ", "robust 245-mile range", ". There weren\u2019t even Superchargers when the Roadster was released, but the car proved that EVs could comfortably go beyond the 200-mile mark, and then some more. Interestingly, even modern EVs from veteran carmakers are finding it hard to match the Roadster\u2019s 245-mile EPA range. The Audi e-tron, for example, just has 204 miles of range per charge, while the award-winning I-PACE has an EPA rating of 234 miles per charge.\u00a0", "This, according to veteran auto experts Sandy Munro and Mark Ellis of Munro & Associates, has a lot to do with Tesla\u2019s ", "all-electric platform", " and the company\u2019s proprietary battery tech. Tesla is only 16 years old, and thus, it only has a fraction of the experience that its rivals in the auto market has. Yet in the EV segment, Tesla is among the veterans, having worked solely on electric cars since Day One.\u00a0", "As such, vehicles that Tesla releases such as the Model S, Model X, and Model 3, are designed as EVs from the get-go.

Porsche opted to design the Taycan from a clean sheet, and the result was an all-electric sports car that can attack the track just as aggressively as the next 911. It even has a frunk like a Tesla, albeit smaller. Mercedes, on the other hand, opted to base the EQC on its existing GLC platform, and the result is an EV that still has echoes of its ", "internal combustion roots", ". Between the two vehicles, it is easy to see which carmaker put more effort, and it shows. Today, it appears that the non-Tesla EV community is far more excited about the Taycan than they are for the EQC.\u00a0", "Mark Ellis, a senior master of lean design and battery consultant, notes that this is a key advantage that is inherent in Tesla. \u201cOne of Elon Musk\u2019s big advantages is, basically, that the vehicle is designed to be an electric car. Musk designed every aspect of this car to be as efficient as possible,\u201d he ", "said", ".\u00a0", "Apart from their all-electric design, Tesla\u2019s secret sauce for its vehicles lies in their batteries, from the design of the pack to the chemistry of the cells themselves. Comparing the ", "Model 3\u2019s battery pack", " to those found in other EVs such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf, Jaguar I-PACE, and BMW i3, Ellis stated that Tesla\u2019s battery pack is superior, especially with regards to the placement of battery cells in relation to the current collectors. \u201cIt\u2019s the best design of any battery pack I\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "But this is not all. Ellis added that Tesla\u2019s cylindrical cells have inherent advantages compared to the prismatic or pouch cells used by the competition. Prismatic cells, for one, expand and contract as they charge and discharge, which means that manufacturers using them have to design their battery packs with the necessary parts to handle the expansion and contraction process of the cells. These add unnecessary weight to a battery, which Tesla\u2019s packs don\u2019t have to deal with.\u00a0", "Ultimately, Ellis explained that Tesla\u2019s battery cells simply have a higher energy density than those utilized by its competition. Tesla was able to achieve this because its batteries have superior chemistry, the consultant said. Part of the reason behind this is the fact that Tesla as a company does not really stop innovating. Tesla\u2019s Automotive President Jerome Guillen hinted at this in a previous interview, when he said that the company\u2019s batteries are never frozen since they are ", "always in a state of improvement", ". \u201cWe are improving the design of the cell. The design of the cell is not frozen. It evolves, and we have a nice roadmap of technology improvements for the coming years,\u201d Guillen said.", "Range is something that is one of the most important factors consumers consider when purchasing an electric car. With the number of EV charging stations not yet on par with the number of gas stations on the road, it is pertinent for customers for many car buyers to acquire a vehicle that can go the distance. Tesla\u2019s long-range vehicles, together with the company\u2019s Supercharger Network, are a perfect fit for these types of customers. "]},

With this in mind, the Model Y could even be described as a Trojan Horse of sorts, carrying the electric car maker\u2019s innovations (mostly) under the radar.

The company has been pretty secretive about the details of its latest battery tech innovations, but the unveiling of vehicles like the Cybertruck, whose top-tier variant goes over 500 miles of range for a price that\u2019s less than $70,000, suggests that these improvements are significant.

We have no plans to advertise at this time. At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure they are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising,\u201d Musk said. ", "In a conversation with ", "Teslarati", ", investor and economist ", "@Incentives101", " explained that if one looks at Tesla\u2019s word-of-mouth strategy from a mathematical perspective, it would seem that Elon Musk\u2019s stern stance against traditional advertising may actually be well justified. Considering the manner that Tesla has been growing so far, the economist noted that \u201cElon is probably right. They don\u2019t need advertisement and probably will never need it.\u201d The following sections explains this point. ", "There are generally three ways a new customer could learn about Tesla and its products: 1)Elon\u2019s/Tesla goodwill, 2) customers\u2019 own research, or 3) through an existing Tesla owner. Tesla relies heavily on current owners spreading the word and ", "converting people they know", " into new electric car owners. Most people call this strategy the \u201cNetwork Effect,\u201d but the economist states that this is a misinterpretation. ", "\u201cThe Network Effect is technically applied to how a product increases its value from a network. The telephone is the most obvious example. One or two telephones in the world are useless, but the more there, are the more useful they become. In a way, you have to treat this like a disease. If you analyze (Tesla\u2019s) strategy, you not only need information to flow. You need the information that changed hands to have an effect. In this case, the purchase of another Tesla. The most similar models to this strategy out there are how diseases spread,\u201d the investor said. ", "These mathematical models try to predict how a disease will be spread considering different assumptions and variables. Among those variables are the number of susceptible individuals, of infected people and of recovered people, as well as the rate of contagion. For purposes of this illustration, information is equal to a virus and the main variables are the number of people that want to buy a car in that period of time within a target price range or TCO (susceptible individuals), the number of owners at the time (infected people), and the average number of people that an owner would convert in that period of time (contagion). This will be referred to in this article as the \u2018T\u2019 variable.", "The investor explains this further in the following statement. \u201cThe easiest way to understand this is the following. Imagine you\u2019re looking at a decision tree. Each node is a new person with a Tesla in a period of time and how many nodes come out of that person is our \u2018T.\u2019 In each period of time that you\u2019d want to measure, there are more assumptions that would need to be made. For example, an owner never \u2018recovers\u2019 so not only they \u2018infect\u2019 people but they will be contagious in perpetuity.", "\u201cLet\u2019s analyze the spectrum of possible solutions. If T>=1, it would mean that information is flowing very efficiently and it will behave exponentially even if the time it takes for an owner to spread enough information to convert someone is relatively high. You need to consider that today, there are more than half a million owners. The faster the person transmits the \u2018virus,\u2019 the better,\u201d he said. ", "There is no way to approximate these variables with the information available to us today. But recently, Tom Randall from ", "Bloomberg", " released the findings of a study involving 5,000 Model 3 owners. According to the study\u2019s results, 99% of Model 3 owners are pretty much satisfied with the vehicle, and they are willing to recommend the electric car to friends and family. A number of assumptions could be drawn from these results, as per the investor. ", "\u201cIf you consider what would be the worst scenario for Tesla, it would mean a very long time for contagion to spread, with the \u2018T\u2019 variable being very close to zero. But with the information provided in the ", "Bloomberg", " report, there is a very high probability that \u2018T\u2019 is not close to zero at all. Instead, there\u2019s a good chance that \u2018T\u2019 is probably very close to 1,\u201d the economist said.

Looking at Tesla\u2019s history, we can see that this strategy or combination of strategies have worked. But is there an optimal time to have an ", "information campaign", "? \u201cIt seems that the sooner, the better\u201d the investor explained. \u201cIf you look at how this strategy functions, theoretically, the best time to have an information campaign is when they\u2019ll have the least amount of owners and when they\u2019ll increase production dramatically. So in theory this means in the next few months as Tesla continues to hit its stride with Model 3 and begin producing the Model Y,  high volume vehicle that Elon Musk expects will outsell the Model S, X, and Model 3 ", "combined", ".

Despite this influx of EVs, Tesla (", "NASDAQ:TSLA", ") bull and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster argues that the Model 3 will likely remain unchallenged.\u00a0", "Currently, there are 17 EVs available in the US market. This is a notable increase from 2018, when there were only 11 that were available for purchase. By next year, there will likely be 24 all-electric cars that buyers could choose from.

In other words, the market isn\u2019t growing much, and Tesla is losing share,\u201d Sacconaghi ", "wrote", ".", "According to TSLA investor ", "@Incentives101", ", an economist with a background in macro research, Bernstein\u2019s conclusions are inaccurate.

Looking at past vehicle sales data, the economist noted that from January-June 2018, Tesla sold 13,426 Model S and X in Europe, while in the first six months of 2019, the figure was 8,037.", "\u201cIn those months of 2018, Norway and the Netherlands accounted for 52% of sales, while in 2019 it was just 28%.

Furthermore, the Netherlands had Model S and X sales for the first six months of 2018 of 2,833 units and 167 for 2019. This means that the Netherlands by itself explains 50% of the drop in sales for Tesla\u2019s flagship vehicles,\u201d the investor wrote.", "If one were to look at the sales of the Audi e-tron and the Jaguar I-PACE in the Netherlands for the first half of 2019, one would find that the two vehicles only sold 362 and 111 units, respectively. This means that in the Netherlands, which was behind 50% of the drop in Tesla\u2019s European sales, the e-tron and I-PACE couldn\u2019t have been responsible since their combined sales are only 16% of the Model S and X\u2019s 2018 sales for the same period. With this in mind, some headwinds were met by the Model S and X in the Netherlands, particularly in the form of a change in BIK incentives at the end of 2018, as well as the ", "arrival of the more affordable Model 3", ", which has reached sales of over 6,000 units in the country.", "As explained by the economist, Norway is a key market for Tesla in the European region, and it is responsible for 37% of the drop in Model S and X sales. For the first six months of 2019, Model S and X sales were 2,079 units, while the Audi e-tron sold 2,273 units and the Jaguar I-PACE sold 2,101.

First off, Tesla discontinued the 75 kWh (Standard Range) Model S and X, a variant that accounted for more than 80% of the sales in the country. More importantly, Tesla has entered the Norwegian market with the Model 3, a smaller, more affordable vehicle that boasts the best technologies that the electric car maker has to offer.\u00a0 \u201cNorwegians have proven preferences for smaller and cheaper vehicles. Historically, the share of luxury vehicles in Norway is relatively low. It is then by no surprise that the Model 3 is currently selling at levels not seen in any other market, ", "holding 14% of market share", " for total vehicles,\u201d the economist explained.", "In Norway\u2019s case, at least, Tesla appears to have made a notable trade-off. It entered the market with the Model 3, which allowed the company to command 14% of the country\u2019s total vehicle market. This came at a price in the form of a 50% decline in Model S and X sales. Of course, the removal of the Model S and X\u2019s 75 kWh variant, as well as buyer expectations of an impending refresh of the two flagship vehicles, likely played a notable part in Norway\u2019s sales decline as well.", "With these factors in mind, it appears that Bernstein\u2019s findings are, for lack of a better term, inaccurate. The economist summed up his thesis as follows. \u201cTwo countries explain the drop in sales for the Model S and X almost entirely, and it\u2019s absolutely clear that competition wasn\u2019t the factor. Regulation and consumer preferences are. It is also important to mention that 28% of sales of the Audi e-tron were in Germany as well, a country where the Model S and X have never been strong, even at their peak. ", "\u201cConsumers in the aggregate always behave rationally. There hasn\u2019t been one example in history where a product(s) that is inferior in every way dominates the market or segment in which they compete. The Audi e-tron, the Jaguar I-PACE, and the Mercedes-Benz EQC are not even in the Model S and X segment specs-wise. Rather, they are closer in specs to the Model 3 and Model Y, both of which undercut them in price. The only reason people mistakenly put them against the Model S and X is their cost,\u201d the investor explained."]},

It was a lofty goal, near-impossible at the time. Yet, more than a decade and several all-electric vehicles later, Musk\u2019s dream and his all-too-familiar Master Plan are actually happening.\u00a0", "Spurred by the success and the demand generated by vehicles like the Tesla Model S and Model 3, the auto industry is shifting towards electric transportation. Coupled with the ongoing climate emergency, several regions across the globe are also looking to drastically reduce their emissions, and one of the ways they are doing that is by phasing out the internal combustion engine. Paul Eichenberg, managing director of Paul Eichenberg Strategic Consulting and a longtime veteran in the auto industry, discussed these shifts in a recent appearance at ", "Autoline After Hours", ".\u00a0", "During his discussions, Eichenberg noted that the auto industry, including the companies comprising its large supply chain, is already undergoing a steady departure from ICE technology. Aggressive emissions targets in regions such as Europe and China will eventually make it impossible for gas and diesel-powered vehicles to comply unless they become electric. Technological advancements such as autonomous driving solutions are also becoming a priority. This could be seen in how massive companies such as Volkswagen and Ford are currently partnering in a push towards EVs and full self-driving technology.

Tesla might still be learning the ropes when it comes to running a car business, but it is becoming undeniable that the company has created an objectively superior product. Sandy Munro, who has torn down the Tesla Model 3 and other EVs like the Chevy Bolt and the BMW i3, remarked that Tesla\u2019s electric sedan is at least a generation ahead of what other companies have put on the road in terms of the architecture, the electronic systems, and the software surrounding the vehicle. Tesla still needs to figure out a consistent way to make money, but in terms of the electric cars themselves, the company seems to have everything figured out.\u00a0", "With traditional auto catching up to upstart companies like Tesla, large carmakers are now looking to leverage the innovations from younger, smaller companies.

Eichenberg gave an example of this in a brief discussion about forgings. \u201cIf you look at the forgings, a typical vehicle like the Pacifica \u2014 you know, V6, 8-speed \u2014 that has 107 forgings in it, in just that traditional ICE engine ecosystem. When you go to an electric vehicle, whether it\u2019s the (BMW) i3, the Teslas, the (Chevy) Bolt, whatever it is, there\u2019s eight or nine. So you have a 90% over-capacitation of an industry. And here\u2019s an industry that\u2019s only 90 billion globally, and half of everything it does is in the engine-transmission ecosystem,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "Elaborating further, Eichenberg mentioned that big-tier corporations such as Honeywell and Delphi, whose businesses are tied to the internal combustion engine, are now positioning themselves through spinoffs as a way to shed their ICE-centered assets. Unfortunately, smaller companies don\u2019t have it as easy, particularly as private equities and investors do not seem interested in ICE innovations anymore. Eichenberg shared the story of Dayco, a private equity-owned business which experienced multiple failed sale processes.

It was not until Tesla revealed its higher-than-expected delivery and production numbers in the second quarter that the narrative surrounding the company shifted a little bit for the better.", "Being one of the most shorted companies in the market, Tesla is no stranger to misinformation campaigns. The company\u2019s vehicles consistently rank high with safety agencies, yet the idea that the Model 3, S, and X are dangerous and catch fire all the time continues to persist. Tesla\u2019s ", "quarterly safety reports", " have consistently shown that fewer accidents happen when Autopilot is activated, but the driver-assist system is perceived as dangerous by a notable demographic of would-be car buyers nonetheless \u2014 and these are but the tip of the iceberg. ", "One of the most striking portions of Tesla\u2019s ", "2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting", " last month involved a number of retail investors brainstorming solutions to address the alarming amount of misinformation surrounding the company. Responding to the concerned shareholders, Elon Musk admitted that he is at a little bit of a loss when it comes to battling the negativity surrounding Tesla, though he expressed his dislike for advertising campaigns that are deceptive to consumers. Nevertheless, considering that the Tesla Model 3 is now breaking into a market that is larger than it has ever dealt with before, it would be wise for the electric car maker to find a solid, subtle strategy that allows it to reach a wider audience, while shifting the narrative to a more positive direction in the process.", "What is pretty remarkable is that Tesla does not need to look far to find a marketing strategy that works without being deceptive.

That company is Tesla.", "Tesla has been around in China since 2014, when it started delivering the Model S to the region. For the most part, Tesla has competed much like a niche carmaker in the country, with the Model S and Model X being high-priced premium vehicles that are, in some way, considered as status symbols for the wealthy. This is changing with the arrival of the Model 3, as the electric sedan\u2019s lower price opens up the Tesla ecosystem to a far broader demographic. The buildout of Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, which will be producing locally-made Model 3 and Model Y, will make Tesla\u2019s vehicles even more accessible to the mainstream market in the near future.", "With Model 3 deliveries already underway and with Gigafactory 3\u2019s buildout progressing faster than expected, it is pertinent for Tesla to ensure that the company is well marketed for Chinese consumers. This is where things get particularly interesting, since Tesla has been conducting a subtle, clever, and likely effective marketing campaign for the Chinese market as of late. Immediately noticeable is the care that the company has taken to respect the country\u2019s culture and traditions, as shown in the ", "tastefully-designed cards", " Tesla sent out during last month\u2019s Dragon Boat Festival, and the reviewers that the electric car maker released for high school students in the days leading up to the national college examination.

Just recently, Tesla and QQ Music, a popular music streaming service in the country, held a series of \u201cMusic Parties\u201d in key cities. These were hip events that were aimed at the younger demographic, many of whom are or will be looking to buy their first vehicle in the near future. The company has also launched a Tesla Performance Driving School, which involves the company hiring professional drivers to teach Model 3 owners how to get the most fun out of their vehicles. This program promotes the capabilities of the Model 3 Performance, while giving the impression that Tesla is a responsible company that encourages high-speed driving in safe, regulated environments.", "Also notable were Tesla-organized road trips, which are extended journeys over scenic routes that are aimed at promoting the company\u2019s vehicles and the convenience of the Supercharger Network. Online, Tesla\u2019s active marketing strategies in China are quite impressive as well, as evidenced by the spread of tutorials featuring its vehicles and their features. These pages, one which could be accessed ", "here", ", feature clear guidelines about Autopilot\u2019s proper utilization, its features, its limitations, and the responsibilities of the driver while the system is in use.", "When it comes to battling misinformation, the best strategy is always to provide the right information. To shift a subjectively negative narrative, it is best to foster an objectively positive narrative. Contrary to Elon Musk\u2019s statements during the Annual Shareholder Meeting, it appears that Tesla already has a pretty good strategy that has the potential to address, at least to some degree, the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding the company in the United States. Granted, Tesla currently enjoys widespread support from the Chinese government, and the United States is a far more challenging market than China, but considering what\u2019s at stake, these marketing efforts might very well be worth a try.
